# Risk Management

Framework for identifying, assessing, and managing information security and privacy risks.

## Purpose

Define risk appetite, assessment methodology, and decision-making processes.

## Philosophy

**Risk-Informed**: Enable business with calculated risks, balance security with usability

**Continuous**: Integrated into daily operations, monitor evolving threats, reassess when environment changes

**Shared Responsibility**: Security owns framework, everyone manages risk

## Risk Appetite: Moderate

- **Low tolerance**: Customer data confidentiality, privacy violations
- **Moderate tolerance**: Availability risks, emerging technology risks
- **High tolerance**: Internal operational risks

## Risk Thresholds

- **Critical**: Unacceptable - remediate immediately or escalate
- **High**: Executive approval required with compensating controls
- **Medium**: Acceptable with mitigation plan and timeline
- **Low**: Acceptable, track and reassess periodically

## Risk Scoring

**Likelihood**: Low (1) < 10%, Medium (2) 10-50%, High (3) > 50%

**Impact**: Low (1) < $10k, Medium (2) $10k-$100k, High (3) > $100k

**Risk Score = Likelihood × Impact**

| Score | Level | Response |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 1-2 | Low | Accept or mitigate opportunistically |
| 3-4 | Medium | Mitigate within 90 days |
| 6 | High | Mitigate within 30 days |
| 9 | Critical | Mitigate within 7 days |

## Assessment Triggers

- New project/initiative
- New technology/vendor
- Regulatory changes
- Security incidents
- Annual review

## Treatment Options

**Mitigate**: Implement controls to reduce likelihood/impact
**Accept**: Acknowledge and proceed (document, approve, review)
**Avoid**: Change approach to eliminate risk
**Transfer**: Shift to third party (insurance, outsourcing)

## Decision Authority

| Level | Authority | Approval |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Low | Security Team | Document in register |
| Medium | Security + Engineering Lead | Email approval |
| High | CTO/Executive | Written approval, quarterly review |
| Critical | CEO/Board | Formal approval, monthly review |

## Risk Register

Track: ID, description, category, likelihood/impact, score, owner, status, treatment plan, dates

Review: Monthly (new/updates), Quarterly (all open), Annually (comprehensive)

## Integration with Development

**Security Design Review**: Assess all new features before development
**Threat Modeling**: For high-risk systems (STRIDE methodology)

## Metrics

- Open risks by severity
- Risk aging and remediation velocity
- Acceptance rate
- Trend analysis
