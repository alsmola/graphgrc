# Governance

Strategic framework for the organization's information security program.

## Purpose

Establish mission, scope, authority, and governance structure to protect organizational and customer assets through risk-based security controls.

## Mission

Protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data by implementing risk-based controls, fostering security-aware culture, and continuously improving security posture.

## Scope

- All information systems (cloud, applications, endpoints)
- All data (customer, employee, business)
- All personnel (employees, contractors, vendors)
- All locations (offices, remote, data centers)

## Security Principles

**Risk-Based**: Focus on highest risks (likelihood × impact), document decisions

**Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers, no single point of failure

**Least Privilege**: Minimum access necessary, regular reviews

**Security by Design**: Consider security from project start, secure defaults

**Transparency**: Clear ownership, blameless culture, visible posture

## Governance Structure

**Security Team**: Develop policies, conduct assessments, monitor controls, manage incidents

**Executive Sponsor** (CTO/CEO): Approve program, provide resources, accept high risks

**Engineering Teams**: Implement controls, remediate vulnerabilities, follow secure practices

**All Employees**: Follow policies, complete training, report incidents

## Program Components

1. Governance (policies, risk management, compliance, training)
2. Identity & Access Management (SSO, MFA, RBAC, reviews)
3. Data Protection (classification, encryption, retention, privacy)
4. Secure Development (secure coding, reviews, scanning, secrets)
5. Infrastructure Security (cloud baselines, segmentation, logging, patching)
6. Endpoint Security (MDM, encryption, EDR, updates)
7. Vendor Risk (assessments, DPAs, monitoring)
8. Incident Response (detection, procedures, notification, reviews)
9. Business Continuity (backup, recovery, disaster planning)

## Metrics

- MTTR for vulnerabilities by severity
- Phishing click rate (target <5%)
- Training completion (target 100%)
- Access review completion (100% quarterly)
- Open Critical/High vulnerabilities (0/5)

## Compliance

- SOC 2 Type II (annual audit)
- GDPR (DPIAs, DPAs, breach notification)
- Internal audits (quarterly self-assessment)

## Review

Annual review by Security Team, approved by executive sponsor.
