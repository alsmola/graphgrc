# NIST 800-53v5 - AC-2.7 - Privileged User Accounts
- Establish and administer privileged user accounts in accordance with \[ Assignment:  \];
- Monitor privileged role or attribute assignments;
- Monitor changes to roles or attributes; and
- Revoke access when privileged role or attribute assignments are no longer appropriate.
## Guidance
Privileged roles are organization-defined roles assigned to individuals that allow those individuals to perform certain security-relevant functions that ordinary users are not authorized to perform. Privileged roles include key management, account management, database administration, system and network administration, and web administration. A role-based access scheme organizes permitted system access and privileges into roles. In contrast, an attribute-based access scheme specifies allowed system access and privileges based on attributes.
