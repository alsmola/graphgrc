# NIST 800-53v5 - SC-5 - Denial-of-service Protection
-  \[ Assignment:  \] the effects of the following types of denial-of-service events: {{ insert: param, sc-05_odp.01 }} ; and
- Employ the following controls to achieve the denial-of-service objective: \[ Assignment: controls by type of denial-of-service event \].
## Guidance
Denial-of-service events may occur due to a variety of internal and external causes, such as an attack by an adversary or a lack of planning to support organizational needs with respect to capacity and bandwidth. Such attacks can occur across a wide range of network protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6). A variety of technologies are available to limit or eliminate the origination and effects of denial-of-service events. For example, boundary protection devices can filter certain types of packets to protect system components on internal networks from being directly affected by or the source of denial-of-service attacks. Employing increased network capacity and bandwidth combined with service redundancy also reduces the susceptibility to denial-of-service events.
