# NIST 800-53v5 - RA-5.3 - Breadth and Depth of Coverage
## Guidance
The breadth of vulnerability scanning coverage can be expressed as a percentage of components within the system, by the particular types of systems, by the criticality of systems, or by the number of vulnerabilities to be checked. Conversely, the depth of vulnerability scanning coverage can be expressed as the level of the system design that the organization intends to monitor (e.g., component, module, subsystem, element). Organizations can determine the sufficiency of vulnerability scanning coverage with regard to its risk tolerance and other factors. Scanning tools and how the tools are configured may affect the depth and coverage. Multiple scanning tools may be needed to achieve the desired depth and coverage. [SP 800-53A](#a21aef46-7330-48a0-b2e1-c5bb8b2dd11d) provides additional information on the breadth and depth of coverage.
