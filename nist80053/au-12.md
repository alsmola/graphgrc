# NIST 800-53v5 - AU-12 - Audit Record Generation
- Provide audit record generation capability for the event types the system is capable of auditing as defined in [AU-2a](#au-2_smt.a) on \[ Assignment: system components \];
- Allow \[ Assignment: personnel or roles \] to select the event types that are to be logged by specific components of the system; and
- Generate audit records for the event types defined in [AU-2c](#au-2_smt.c) that include the audit record content defined in [AU-3](#au-3).
## Guidance
Audit records can be generated from many different system components. The event types specified in [AU-2d](#au-2_smt.d) are the event types for which audit logs are to be generated and are a subset of all event types for which the system can generate audit records.
