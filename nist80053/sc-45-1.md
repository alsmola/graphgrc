# NIST 800-53v5 - SC-45.1 - Synchronization with Authoritative Time Source
- Compare the internal system clocks \[ Assignment: frequency \] with {{ insert: param, sc-45.01_odp.02 }} ; and
- Synchronize the internal system clocks to the authoritative time source when the time difference is greater than \[ Assignment: time period \].
- 
## Guidance
Synchronization of internal system clocks with an authoritative source provides uniformity of time stamps for systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected over a network.
