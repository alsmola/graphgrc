# NIST 800-53v5 - SI-6 - Security and Privacy Function Verification
- Verify the correct operation of \[ Assignment: organization-defined security and privacy functions \];
- Perform the verification of the functions specified in SI-6a \[ Assignment:  \];
- Alert \[ Assignment: personnel or roles \] to failed security and privacy verification tests; and
-  \[ Assignment:  \] when anomalies are discovered.
## Guidance
Transitional states for systems include system startup, restart, shutdown, and abort. System notifications include hardware indicator lights, electronic alerts to system administrators, and messages to local computer consoles. In contrast to security function verification, privacy function verification ensures that privacy functions operate as expected and are approved by the senior agency official for privacy or that privacy attributes are applied or used as expected.
