# NIST 800-53v5 - SI-4.1 - System-wide Intrusion Detection System
## Guidance
Linking individual intrusion detection tools into a system-wide intrusion detection system provides additional coverage and effective detection capabilities. The information contained in one intrusion detection tool can be shared widely across the organization, making the system-wide detection capability more robust and powerful.
