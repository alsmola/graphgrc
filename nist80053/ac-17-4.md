# NIST 800-53v5 - AC-17.4 - Privileged Commands and Access
- Authorize the execution of privileged commands and access to security-relevant information via remote access only in a format that provides assessable evidence and for the following needs: \[ Assignment: organization-defined needs \] ; and
- Document the rationale for remote access in the security plan for the system.
## Guidance
Remote access to systems represents a significant potential vulnerability that can be exploited by adversaries. As such, restricting the execution of privileged commands and access to security-relevant information via remote access reduces the exposure of the organization and the susceptibility to threats by adversaries to the remote access capability.
