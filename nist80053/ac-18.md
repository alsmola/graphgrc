# NIST 800-53v5 - AC-18 - Wireless Access
- Establish configuration requirements, connection requirements, and implementation guidance for each type of wireless access; and
- Authorize each type of wireless access to the system prior to allowing such connections.
## Guidance
Wireless technologies include microwave, packet radio (ultra-high frequency or very high frequency), 802.11x, and Bluetooth. Wireless networks use authentication protocols that provide authenticator protection and mutual authentication.
