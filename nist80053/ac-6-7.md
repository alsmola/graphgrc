# NIST 800-53v5 - AC-6.7 - Review of User Privileges
- Review \[ Assignment: frequency \] the privileges assigned to {{ insert: param, ac-06.07_odp.02 }} to validate the need for such privileges; and
- Reassign or remove privileges, if necessary, to correctly reflect organizational mission and business needs.
## Guidance
The need for certain assigned user privileges may change over time to reflect changes in organizational mission and business functions, environments of operation, technologies, or threats. A periodic review of assigned user privileges is necessary to determine if the rationale for assigning such privileges remains valid. If the need cannot be revalidated, organizations take appropriate corrective actions.
