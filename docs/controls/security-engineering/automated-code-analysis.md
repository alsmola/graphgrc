# Automated Code Analysis

Control for Automated Code Analysis.

## Objective

Identify security vulnerabilities in code automatically during development through static and dynamic analysis.

## Implementation

**SAST**: Static Application Security Testing (Snyk Code, SonarQube) integrated in CI/CD, scans code for vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets). **Dependency Scanning**: Snyk or Dependabot scans dependencies for known vulnerabilities, creates PRs for updates. **Secret Scanning**: GitGuardian or TruffleHog blocks commits containing secrets. **PR Gates**: Critical/high vulnerabilities block PR merges. **Dashboards**: Engineering leadership monitors security findings, tracks remediation. **SLA**: Critical findings fixed within 7 days, high within 30 days.

## Evidence

- SAST tool configuration and findings
- Dependency vulnerability reports
- Secret scanning blocks
- PR merge blocking events
- Vulnerability remediation metrics
