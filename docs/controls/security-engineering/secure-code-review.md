# Secure Code Review

Control for Secure Code Review.

## Objective

Review code changes for security vulnerabilities through peer review and security-focused code reviews.

## Implementation

**Mandatory PR Review**: All code changes require at least one peer review before merge. **Security Checklist**: Reviewers check for common vulnerabilities (input validation, authentication, authorization, sensitive data handling). **Security Champion Review**: High-risk changes (authentication, payment processing, data export) reviewed by security champion or security team. **Automated Checks**: SAST, linting, and tests run automatically on PRs. **Training**: Developers receive secure coding training, security champions receive advanced training. **Metrics**: Track PR review time, security findings in review.

## Evidence

- GitHub PR review requirements
- Security code review checklist
- Security champion assignments
