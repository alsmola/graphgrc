# Secure Coding Standards

Control for Secure Coding Standards.

## Objective

Define and enforce secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities during development.

## Implementation

**Standards Documentation**: Secure coding guide covering OWASP Top 10, common vulnerability patterns, language-specific guidance. **Input Validation**: Validate all user input, use parameterized queries, escape output. **Authentication**: Use established libraries (OAuth, SAML), never roll custom crypto. **Authorization**: Implement least privilege, check authorization at resource level, don't trust client-side controls. **Secrets**: Never hardcode secrets, use secrets management service. **Logging**: Log authentication events, authorization failures, never log sensitive data. **Training**: Annual secure coding training for all engineers. **Code Review**: Standards enforced through peer review and automated scanning.

## Evidence

- Secure coding standards document
- OWASP Top 10 remediation guidance
- Secure coding training materials
- Code review enforcement metrics
- Vulnerability findings by category
