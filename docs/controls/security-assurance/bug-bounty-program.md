# Bug Bounty Program

Control for Bug Bounty Program.

## Objective

Crowdsource vulnerability discovery through a bug bounty program, enabling independent researchers to report security issues.

## Implementation

**Bug Bounty Platform**: HackerOne or Bugcrowd manages program. **Scope**: Public-facing web applications and APIs in scope, internal systems out of scope. **Rewards**: Critical $500-$2000, High $200-$500, Medium $50-$200, Low discretionary. **Response SLA**: Triage within 2 business days, fix critical within 30 days. **Safe Harbor**: Policy protects researchers acting in good faith. **Private Program**: Consider starting with private (invite-only) program before going public. **Quarterly Reviews**: Review program metrics, adjust scope and rewards based on findings.

## Evidence

- Bug bounty program policy
- Platform reports (submissions, resolutions, payouts)
- Vulnerability remediation tickets
- Program performance metrics
- Researcher payouts
