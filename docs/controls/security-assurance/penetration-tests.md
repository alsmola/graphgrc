# Penetration Tests

Control for Penetration Tests.

## Objective

Validate security control effectiveness through independent penetration testing, identifying vulnerabilities before attackers do.

## Implementation

**Annual Pentest**: Third-party penetration testing firm tests production systems annually. **Scope**: External pentest (internet-facing systems), internal pentest (assumes breach), web application pentest, API pentest. **Rules of Engagement**: Define testing window, out-of-scope systems, emergency stop procedures. **Findings Remediation**: Critical findings fixed within 30 days, high within 60 days, medium within 90 days. **Retest**: Penetration testing firm retests critical/high findings after remediation. **Report**: Executive summary and detailed technical report provided to security team and executives.

## Evidence

- Penetration test reports (current and historical)
- Remediation tracking for findings
- Retest validation reports
- Penetration test scoping documents
- Vendor invoices and contracts
