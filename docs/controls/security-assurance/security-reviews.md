# Security Reviews

Control for Security Reviews.

## Objective

Review proposed system changes and new features for security implications before implementation.

## Implementation

**Trigger Criteria**: New features handling sensitive data, architecture changes, third-party integrations, new authentication mechanisms. **Review Process**: Engineer submits design doc, security team reviews within 3 business days. **Threat Modeling**: Identify threats using STRIDE methodology, document mitigations. **Security Requirements**: Security team provides specific requirements (encryption, access controls, logging). **Sign-Off**: Security team approves before implementation begins. **Post-Implementation**: Security team verifies requirements implemented correctly. **Quarterly Metrics**: Track reviews conducted, time to review, findings by severity.

## Evidence

- Security review request tickets
- Design review documents with security sign-off
- Threat models
- Security requirements documents
- Post-implementation verification
