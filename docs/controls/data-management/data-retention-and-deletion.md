# Data Retention and Deletion

Control for Data Retention and Deletion.

## Objective

Retain data only as long as needed for business and legal requirements, then securely delete to minimize risk and storage costs.

## Implementation

**Retention Policies**: Customer data 7 years, employee records 7 years, audit logs 2 years, application logs 1 year, system logs 90 days. **Automated Deletion**: S3 lifecycle policies, RDS automated backups, log retention rules automatically delete data past retention period. **Secure Deletion**: S3 bucket versioning disabled or versioned objects purged, RDS snapshots encrypted then deleted. **Legal Hold**: Litigation or investigation triggers legal hold preventing deletion. **Customer Deletion Requests**: GDPR Right to Erasure implemented within 30 days.

## Evidence

- Data retention policy document
- S3 lifecycle policy configurations
- RDS backup retention settings
- Log retention configurations
- Customer deletion request logs
