# Encryption

## Objective

Protect data confidentiality through cryptographic controls.

## Description

All data is encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2+. Sensitive data is encrypted at rest using AES-256. Encryption keys are managed through AWS KMS.

## Implementation

**In Transit**: All external APIs use HTTPS with TLS 1.2+. Internal services use TLS for inter-service communication. No plaintext protocols.

**At Rest**: S3 buckets use SSE-KMS encryption. RDS databases use encryption at rest. EBS volumes encrypted.

**Key Management**: AWS KMS for encryption keys. Keys rotated annually. Access to keys controlled via IAM.

**Endpoints**: macOS FileVault full disk encryption required on all employee devices.

## Examples

- All S3 buckets have default encryption enabled with AWS KMS
- RDS instances configured with encryption at rest using customer managed KMS keys
- Application enforces TLS 1.2 minimum, TLS 1.0/1.1 disabled
- All employee MacBooks have FileVault enabled and verified quarterly

## Evidence

- S3 bucket encryption settings
- RDS encryption configuration
- TLS configuration for load balancers/applications
- MDM reports showing FileVault status on all devices
