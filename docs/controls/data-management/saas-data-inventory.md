# SaaS Data Inventory

Control for SaaS Data Inventory.

## Objective

Maintain inventory of data stored in SaaS applications to understand data location, classification, and compliance obligations.

## Implementation

**SaaS Data Mapping**: Document what data is stored in each SaaS app (Slack, Google Workspace, Salesforce, etc.). **Data Classification**: Classify SaaS data per data classification standard. **Vendor Assessments**: Verify SaaS vendors implement appropriate security controls for data sensitivity. **Data Export**: Quarterly data exports for critical SaaS apps to prevent vendor lock-in. **Compliance Review**: Identify SaaS apps storing data subject to GDPR, CCPA, or other regulations.

## Evidence

- SaaS data inventory spreadsheet
- Data classification per SaaS app
- Vendor security assessments
- SaaS data export logs
