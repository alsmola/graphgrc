# Cloud Data Inventory

Control for Cloud Data Inventory.

## Objective

Maintain comprehensive inventory of data stored in cloud services, classified by sensitivity, to enable proper protection and compliance.

## Implementation

**Data Discovery**: Automated tools (AWS Macie, data classification scanners) identify and classify data in S3, RDS, and other cloud storage. **Data Tagging**: S3 buckets and RDS databases tagged with DataClassification (Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted). **Data Catalog**: AWS Glue Data Catalog or similar maintains metadata about datasets (location, classification, owner, retention). **Quarterly Reviews**: Data owners review inventory for accuracy, identify orphaned data. **Compliance Mapping**: Inventory indicates which data is subject to GDPR, PCI, HIPAA requirements.

## Evidence

- Cloud data inventory reports
- Data classification scan results
- S3 bucket and RDS tagging reports
- Data catalog exports
- Quarterly data inventory reviews
