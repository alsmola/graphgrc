# Data Classification

## Objective

Ensure appropriate protection based on data sensitivity.

## Description

All data is classified as Public, Internal, Confidential, or Restricted. Handling requirements are defined for each classification level.

## Implementation

**Classification Levels**: Public (marketing), Internal (business docs), Confidential (customer PII), Restricted (payment data, PHI).

**Labeling**: Sensitive data stored in dedicated S3 buckets/RDS databases with classification tags.

**Handling Rules**: Restricted data requires encryption at rest and in transit. Access logged and monitored. Cannot be stored on endpoints.

**Training**: Annual data classification training for all employees.

## Examples

- Customer PII stored in S3 bucket tagged 'DataClassification=Confidential'
- No Restricted or Confidential data permitted in Slack or email
- Source code classified as Internal, deployed apps handle Confidential customer data
- Marketing materials classified as Public, customer contracts as Confidential

## Evidence

- Data classification policy
- AWS resource tags showing classifications
- Training completion records
- Data inventory with classifications
