# Risk Assessment

## Objective

Identify and manage security risks to the organization.

## Description

Security risk assessments are conducted annually. Risks are identified, evaluated, and prioritized. Risk treatment plans are developed and tracked. Executive leadership is informed of risk status.

## Implementation

**Annual Risk Assessment**: Formal risk assessment conducted annually. Identify threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, impact.

**Risk Register**: Maintain risk register with identified risks, risk ratings, treatment plans, owners.

**Risk Treatment**: For each risk, document treatment (mitigate, accept, transfer, avoid). Track remediation actions.

**Executive Reporting**: Present risk assessment results to executive team. High/critical risks require executive acceptance or funding for mitigation.

## Examples

- 2024 annual risk assessment identified 15 risks, 3 high, 12 medium
- High risk: No multi-region DR - approved budget for multi-region deployment in Q1 2025
- Risk register tracks 15 open risks, 8 with active remediation
- Quarterly risk status briefing to CEO and board

## Evidence

- Risk assessment methodology
- Risk register with current risks
- Risk treatment plans and remediation status
- Executive presentation and approval records
