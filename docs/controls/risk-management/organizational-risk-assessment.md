# Organizational Risk Assessment

Control for Organizational Risk Assessment.

## Objective

Identify, assess, and track organizational security risks to prioritize mitigation efforts and resource allocation.

## Implementation

**Annual Risk Assessment**: Security team conducts comprehensive risk assessment covering technology, people, processes. **Risk Identification**: Workshops with stakeholders, threat intelligence, vulnerability scans, past incidents. **Risk Scoring**: Likelihood (1-5) × Impact (1-5) = Risk Score. **Risk Register**: Tracked in GRC tool or spreadsheet, includes description, owner, score, mitigation status. **Mitigation Plans**: High/critical risks require documented mitigation plan with timeline. **Quarterly Reviews**: Security Committee reviews risk register, tracks remediation progress. **Metrics**: Track risk trends, time to mitigate, open high/critical risks.

## Evidence

- Annual risk assessment reports
- Risk register
- Risk scoring methodology
- Mitigation plans for high/critical risks
- Quarterly risk review meeting notes
