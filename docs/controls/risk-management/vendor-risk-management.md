# Vendor Risk Management

Control for Vendor Risk Management.

## Objective

Assess and manage security risks from third-party vendors, especially those accessing systems or handling sensitive data.

## Implementation

**Vendor Inventory**: Maintain list of all vendors, categorize by risk (critical, high, medium, low). **Security Assessments**: Critical/high-risk vendors complete security questionnaire, provide SOC 2 report. **DPAs Required**: Data Processing Agreements for vendors processing customer personal data. **Contract Terms**: Contracts include security requirements, audit rights, breach notification obligations. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Annual reassessment for critical vendors, monitor for breaches via threat intelligence. **Offboarding**: Revoke vendor access when contract ends, ensure data deletion.

## Evidence

- Vendor inventory with risk ratings
- Vendor security questionnaires and SOC 2 reports
- Data Processing Agreements
- Vendor risk assessment reports
- Vendor offboarding documentation
