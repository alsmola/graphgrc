# Office Security

Control for Office Security.

## Objective

Protect physical office locations through access controls, visitor management, and security awareness.

## Implementation

**Badge Access**: Office requires badge for entry, issued to employees only. **Visitor Management**: Visitors sign in, receive temporary badge, escorted by employee. **Desk Policy**: Clean desk policy for Confidential documents, lock screens when away. **Secure Areas**: Server rooms or equipment closets require additional access control. **Surveillance**: Security cameras in common areas (lobby, exits), not in private spaces. **Offboarding**: Badges deactivated and collected upon termination. **Remote Work**: Most employees remote, office physical security less critical than cloud/endpoint security.

## Evidence

- Badge access system records
- Visitor logs
- Clean desk policy
- Secure area access logs
- Badge deactivation records
