# Endpoint Network Security

Control for Endpoint Network Security.

## Objective

Protect endpoints from network-based attacks through firewall, VPN, and secure network configurations.

## Implementation

**Host Firewall**: Enabled on all endpoints via MDM configuration profile, only required ports open. **VPN Required**: VPN mandatory for internal resource access from untrusted networks. **Network Segmentation**: Office network separates guest WiFi from corporate. **DNS Filtering**: Corporate DNS blocks malicious domains (via Pi-hole, Cisco Umbrella). **Zero Trust**: Cloud resource access via SSO and IAM, no corporate network trust assumptions. **WPA3**: Office WiFi uses WPA3 encryption or WPA2-Enterprise with certificate authentication.

## Evidence

- Host firewall configuration profiles
- VPN usage logs
- Network architecture diagrams
- DNS filtering block logs
- WiFi security configuration
