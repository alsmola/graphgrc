# Cloud Network Security

Control for Cloud Network Security.

## Objective

Implement network segmentation, access controls, and traffic filtering in cloud environments to prevent unauthorized access and lateral movement.

## Implementation

**VPC Design**: Multi-tier VPC with public, private, and data subnets. **Security Groups**: Deny-by-default, only required ports open, documented business justification. **NACLs**: Network ACLs provide subnet-level controls as defense in depth. **Private Subnets**: Production data systems in private subnets, no direct internet access. **NAT Gateway**: Outbound internet via NAT gateway for private subnets. **VPC Flow Logs**: Enabled for traffic analysis and incident investigation. **Quarterly Reviews**: Review security group rules, remove overly permissive rules.

## Evidence

- VPC architecture diagrams
- Security group configurations
- NACL rules
- VPC Flow Logs enabled
- Quarterly security group audits
