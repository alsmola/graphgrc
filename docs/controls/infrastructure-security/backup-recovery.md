# Backup & Recovery

## Objective

Ensure business continuity through reliable backup and recovery capabilities.

## Description

Critical systems and data are backed up regularly. Backups are encrypted and tested. Disaster recovery procedures are documented and tested annually.

## Implementation

**Database Backups**: RDS automated backups daily with 30-day retention. Manual snapshots before major changes.

**Infrastructure Backups**: Terraform state backed up. AMI snapshots of critical EC2 instances. S3 versioning enabled for application data.

**Backup Testing**: Quarterly restore test from backup to verify recovery. Document restore time and success.

**DR Plan**: Written disaster recovery plan tested annually. Defines RTO (4 hours) and RPO (1 hour) targets.

## Examples

- RDS production database has automated daily backups retained 30 days
- Q4 2024 backup restore test successfully restored production database in 45 minutes
- S3 versioning enabled on all production buckets with MFA delete protection
- Annual DR tabletop exercise completed with documented findings

## Evidence

- Backup configuration showing schedule and retention
- Quarterly backup restore test results
- Disaster recovery plan document
- Annual DR exercise documentation
