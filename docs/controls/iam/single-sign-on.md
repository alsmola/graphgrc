# Single Sign-On

Control for Single Sign-On.

## Objective

Centralize authentication through SSO to reduce password sprawl, improve security, and enable centralized access control.

## Implementation

**SSO Provider**: Okta or Google Workspace as IdP. **SAML/OIDC**: SaaS apps integrated via SAML 2.0 or OpenID Connect. **Directory Sync**: IdP synced with HR system (BambooHR) for automated user lifecycle. **MFA Enforced**: MFA required at IdP level for all users. **Session Management**: Idle timeout 8 hours, users re-authenticate daily. **Cloud Access**: AWS, GCP access via SSO (no local cloud accounts). **Quarterly Reviews**: Review SSO integrations, add new SaaS apps to SSO.

## Evidence

- SSO provider configuration
- SAML/OIDC integration list
- HR system directory sync logs
- MFA enforcement policies
- SSO authentication logs
