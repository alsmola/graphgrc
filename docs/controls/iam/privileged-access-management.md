# Privileged Access Management

## Objective

Protect critical systems through enhanced controls on privileged accounts.

## Description

Administrative and privileged access is tightly controlled, monitored, and audited. Break-glass procedures exist for emergency access.

## Implementation

**Admin Accounts**: Separate admin accounts (admin@) from regular user accounts. MFA required for all admin access.

**AWS Root Account**: Root account MFA enabled with hardware token. Root credentials stored in physical safe. Access requires two executives.

**Session Recording**: All privileged sessions recorded using AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch Logs.

**Break Glass**: Emergency access procedures documented. Break-glass account usage triggers alert to security team and CEO.

## Examples

- AWS root account credentials locked in company safe, requires CEO + CFO
- All admin actions logged to immutable S3 bucket with CloudTrail
- Engineers use elevated privileges via AWS SSO with automatic 4-hour timeout
- Break-glass account last used 6 months ago during critical outage, fully documented

## Evidence

- Privileged account inventory
- AWS CloudTrail logs for admin actions
- Break-glass procedure documentation
- Physical safe access log for root credentials

## Framework Mapping

### SOC 2
- [CC6.1](../../frameworks/soc2/cc61.md) ^[PAM manages administrative authorities and restricts privileged access]
- [CC6.3](../../frameworks/soc2/cc63.md) ^[PAM implements least privilege for elevated permissions]

### GDPR
- [Article 32](../../frameworks/gdpr/art32.md) ^[PAM is an organizational measure controlling access to sensitive personal data]

- [IT Administrator Security Policy](../../policies/it-administrator.md) ^[Separate admin account for privileged operations, just-in-time access, all admin sessions monitored and logged]
- [IT Administrator Security Policy](../../policies/it-administrator.md) ^[IT administrators review privileged access quarterly, deprovision immediately upon termination]
- [Security Team Policy](../../policies/security-team.md) ^[Access production for security investigations only, document reason, use separate admin accounts, no standing production access (JIT only)]
