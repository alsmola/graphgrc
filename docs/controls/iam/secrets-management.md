# Secrets Management

Control for Secrets Management.

## Objective

Securely store and manage application secrets (API keys, database passwords) to prevent exposure and unauthorized access.

## Implementation

**Secrets Manager**: AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault stores all application secrets. **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Automated scanning (TruffleHog, GitGuardian) detects hardcoded secrets in code, blocks commits. **Dynamic Secrets**: Database credentials rotated automatically by Secrets Manager. **Least Privilege**: Applications granted access only to required secrets via IAM policies. **Audit Logging**: All secret access logged via CloudTrail. **Rotation**: API keys rotated every 90 days, database passwords rotated every 30 days automatically.

## Evidence

- Secrets Manager inventory
- Secret scanning tool configuration and alerts
- Secret rotation logs
- IAM policies for secret access
- CloudTrail secret access logs
