# Access Reviews

## Objective

Ensure access remains appropriate and remove unnecessary permissions.

## Description

User access rights are reviewed quarterly. Terminated employees have access revoked immediately. Role changes trigger access recertification.

## Implementation

**Quarterly Reviews**: Managers review team access to AWS, GitHub, production systems. Document reviews in ticketing system.

**Automated Reports**: Generate quarterly access reports from SSO and AWS IAM Identity Center showing user permissions.

**Deprovisioning**: Automated employee offboarding removes all access within 1 hour of termination.

**Role Changes**: Transfer or promotion triggers access review within 5 business days.

## Examples

- Q1 2025 access review completed with all managers certifying team permissions
- SCIM integration automatically provisions/deprovisions users in Okta
- GitHub organization access reviewed quarterly with inactive members removed
- AWS access report shows no users with permissions exceeding their role

## Evidence

- Quarterly access review records
- Manager approval documentation
- Deprovisioning logs
- Before/after snapshots of user permissions
