# Multi-Factor Authentication

Control for Multi-Factor Authentication.

## Objective

Require multiple authentication factors to protect against credential theft and phishing attacks.

## Implementation

**MFA Mandatory**: Enforced for all users accessing production systems via SSO (Okta, Google Workspace). **WebAuthn Preferred**: Hardware security keys (YubiKey) or platform authenticators (Touch ID) preferred over TOTP. **Phishing-Resistant**: WebAuthn/FIDO2 prevents phishing, SMS-based MFA prohibited. **Recovery**: Backup authentication methods registered (multiple security keys). **Compliance**: MFA status monitored, users without MFA blocked after 7 days. **Admin Access**: Admin/privileged accounts require phishing-resistant MFA.

## Evidence

- IdP MFA enforcement policies
- User MFA enrollment reports (100% target)
- WebAuthn/hardware key inventory
- MFA authentication logs
- Admin account MFA requirements
