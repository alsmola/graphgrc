# SaaS IAM

Control for SaaS IAM.

## Objective

Centralize SaaS application access through SSO with automated provisioning and deprovisioning.

## Implementation

**SSO Integration**: All production SaaS apps integrated with SSO (Okta, Google Workspace). **SCIM Provisioning**: Automated user provisioning and deprovisioning via SCIM protocol. **MFA at IdP**: MFA enforced centrally at IdP, not per-app. **Role Mapping**: IdP groups map to SaaS app roles (e.g., Okta Engineering group → GitHub Engineers team). **Access Requests**: ServiceNow or similar for SaaS access requests, manager approval required. **Quarterly Reviews**: Review SaaS access, remove unused accounts.

## Evidence

- SSO integration configuration per SaaS app
- SCIM provisioning logs
- IdP group to SaaS role mappings
- Access request records
- Quarterly SaaS access reviews
