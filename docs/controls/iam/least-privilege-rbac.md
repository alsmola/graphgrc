# Least Privilege & RBAC

## Objective

Minimize risk by ensuring users only have access needed for their role.

## Description

Access to systems and data is granted based on job function using role-based access control. Users receive minimum necessary permissions. Production access requires additional approval.

## Implementation

**RBAC Model**: Define roles for Engineering, Support, Admin, etc. Map users to roles in identity provider.

**AWS Access**: Use AWS SSO permission sets tied to job functions. No direct IAM user access. Separate read-only and admin roles.

**Production Access**: Requires manager approval. Time-limited sessions using AWS SSO or just-in-time access tools.

**Service Accounts**: Use AWS IAM roles with scoped policies. No broad wildcard permissions.

## Examples

- Engineers have read-only production access by default
- Admin access to production requires manager approval and expires after 8 hours
- AWS IAM roles follow principle of least privilege with no wildcard (*) permissions
- Support team has limited read access to customer data based on support case

## Evidence

- RBAC role definitions and mappings
- AWS IAM policies showing least privilege
- Production access approval logs
- Access review documentation
