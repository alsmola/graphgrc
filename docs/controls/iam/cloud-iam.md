# Cloud IAM

Control for Cloud IAM.

## Objective

Manage cloud infrastructure access using identity-based policies, roles, and least privilege principles.

## Implementation

**AWS IAM**: Users access via SSO (AWS IAM Identity Center), no long-lived credentials. **Role-Based Access**: Engineers get read-only by default, elevated access requires approval and time-bound sessions. **Service Accounts**: EC2 instances use IAM roles, Lambda functions use execution roles (no embedded credentials). **MFA Required**: MFA enforced for console access. **Permission Boundaries**: Limit maximum permissions for delegated admin. **Quarterly Reviews**: Review IAM users, roles, policies for least privilege.

## Evidence

- AWS IAM SSO configuration
- IAM role definitions and policies
- IAM credential report (no unused credentials)
- MFA enforcement settings
- Quarterly IAM access reviews
