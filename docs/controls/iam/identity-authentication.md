# Identity & Authentication

## Objective

Ensure all users are uniquely identified and authenticated using strong, phishing-resistant methods.

## Description

All access to systems requires authentication using WebAuthn/passkeys or SSO with MFA. Password-only authentication is not permitted for any production systems.

## Implementation

**User Authentication**: Okta or Google Workspace for SSO with MFA required. WebAuthn/passkeys enforced for all users. AWS IAM Identity Center for cloud access.

**No Passwords**: No service account passwords - use IAM roles or workload identity instead.

**Access Methods**: SSO login for all SaaS tools. AWS access via SSO only (no long-lived credentials). GitHub protected by SSO + WebAuthn. API keys rotated every 90 days.

## Examples

- All employees use Yubikeys for WebAuthn authentication
- AWS access requires SSO through Okta with MFA
- Password-only authentication disabled for all production systems
- Service accounts use IAM roles instead of credentials

## Evidence

- SSO configuration showing MFA enforcement
- User directory with MFA enrollment status
- AWS IAM policy requiring SSO
- Access logs showing authentication methods
