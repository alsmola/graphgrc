# Password Management

Control for Password Management.

## Objective

Ensure strong, unique passwords for all accounts through password manager adoption and password policy enforcement.

## Implementation

**Password Manager Required**: All employees issued 1Password for business, usage monitored. **SSO Preferred**: Reduce passwords by SSO integration for SaaS apps. **Password Policy**: Minimum 12 characters for accounts not using SSO, complexity requirements enforced. **No Reuse**: Password manager prevents reuse across services. **Credential Scanning**: Monitor for compromised passwords in breaches (1Password Watchtower, Have I Been Pwned). **Rotation**: Passwords changed immediately if compromised, otherwise no forced rotation (per NIST guidance).

## Evidence

- 1Password for Business deployment
- Password policy configuration
- SSO integration list
- Compromised credential alerts
- Password manager adoption reports
