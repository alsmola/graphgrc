## Objective

Manage security risks from third-party relationships.

## Description

Vendors with access to systems or data undergo security assessment. High-risk vendors complete security questionnaire. Security requirements are included in vendor contracts.

## Implementation

**Security Questionnaire**: High-risk vendors complete security questionnaire (SIG Lite or custom). Review responses for red flags.

**Contract Requirements**: Vendor contracts include security requirements, audit rights, data handling obligations, breach notification.

**Annual Review**: High-risk vendor security posture reviewed annually. Request updated documentation (SOC 2, ISO 27001, pentests).
