# Vendor Contracts & DPAs

## Objective

Ensure vendors meet security and privacy obligations through contractual controls.

## Description

Vendor contracts include security, privacy, and compliance requirements. Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) are executed with vendors processing customer data. Vendor compliance is monitored.

## Implementation

**Contract Requirements**: All vendor contracts reviewed by legal and security. Include security standards, SLA, audit rights, termination clause.

**DPAs**: DPAs executed with any vendor processing customer personal data (GDPR requirement). Standard DPA template approved by legal.

**SLA Monitoring**: Monitor vendor SLAs for availability, incident notification, data deletion. Escalate breaches to vendor management.

**Contract Repository**: Central repository (DocuSign, Ironclad) for vendor contracts and DPAs. Track expiration and renewal dates.

## Examples

- AWS DPA executed and covers all regions where customer data resides
- Support ticketing system vendor signed DPA before handling customer PII
- Contract repository shows 100% of high-risk vendors have executed DPAs
- Vendor missed SLA for incident notification, escalated and process improved

## Evidence

- Vendor contract templates
- DPA template and executed DPAs
- Contract repository/register
- SLA monitoring and escalation records
