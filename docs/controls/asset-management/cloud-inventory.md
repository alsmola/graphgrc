# Cloud Inventory

Control for Cloud Inventory.

## Objective

Maintain accurate, real-time inventory of all cloud resources to enable security monitoring, cost optimization, and compliance tracking.

## Implementation

**AWS Resource Tagging**: All resources tagged with: Owner, Environment (prod/staging/dev), DataClassification, CostCenter. **Automated Discovery**: AWS Config continuously discovers and records all resources. **Inventory Dashboard**: Cloud asset management tool (e.g., AWS Systems Manager Inventory, CloudQuery) aggregates resources across accounts. **Drift Detection**: Daily scans identify untagged or non-compliant resources. **Quarterly Reviews**: Asset owners verify inventory accuracy.

## Evidence

- AWS Config resource inventory reports
- Cloud asset management dashboard exports
- Resource tagging compliance reports
- Quarterly inventory review sign-offs
- Untagged resource remediation tickets
