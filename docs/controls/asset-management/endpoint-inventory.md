# Endpoint Inventory

Control for Endpoint Inventory.

## Objective

Maintain complete inventory of all endpoint devices (laptops, desktops, mobile devices) to ensure security controls are applied and track device lifecycle.

## Implementation

**MDM Enrollment**: All company devices enrolled in MDM (Jamf for macOS, Intune for Windows). **Automated Discovery**: MDM automatically discovers enrolled devices. **Inventory Tracking**: Device attributes recorded: Serial number, OS version, last check-in, assigned user, enrollment date. **BYOD Policy**: Personal devices accessing company resources must enroll or use virtual desktop. **Decommissioning**: Devices removed from inventory upon employee offboarding or hardware refresh.

## Evidence

- MDM device inventory reports
- Device enrollment logs
- Hardware asset register
- Device assignment records
- Decommissioning documentation
