# SaaS Inventory

Control for SaaS Inventory.

## Objective

Maintain comprehensive inventory of all SaaS applications to manage access, monitor security posture, and prevent shadow IT.

## Implementation

**Procurement Approval**: All SaaS purchases require IT and Security approval. **SSO Integration**: Production SaaS tools integrated with SSO for visibility. **CASB Monitoring**: Cloud Access Security Broker (e.g., Netskope) discovers SaaS usage via network traffic analysis. **Quarterly Reviews**: IT reviews SaaS inventory, identifies shadow IT, and assesses security posture. **Vendor Risk**: Critical SaaS apps undergo vendor risk assessment.

## Evidence

- SaaS application inventory (IT procurement system)
- SSO integration list
- CASB shadow IT reports
- Quarterly SaaS review documentation
- Vendor risk assessment records
