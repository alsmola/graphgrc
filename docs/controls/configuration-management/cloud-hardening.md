# Cloud Hardening

Control for Cloud Hardening.

## Objective

Apply security hardening standards to all cloud infrastructure to reduce attack surface and prevent misconfigurations.

## Implementation

**CIS Benchmarks**: Apply CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark configurations. **Security Baselines**: AWS Security Hub checks for security best practices (S3 public access blocked, EBS encryption enabled, unused credentials removed). **Infrastructure-as-Code**: Terraform templates include security configurations by default (encrypted storage, private subnets, security group restrictions). **Continuous Compliance**: AWS Config rules monitor for configuration drift, auto-remediate or alert. **Quarterly Reviews**: Review and update hardening standards based on new threats and AWS features.

## Evidence

- CIS Benchmark compliance reports
- AWS Security Hub findings
- Terraform security configurations
- AWS Config compliance dashboard
- Hardening standard review records
