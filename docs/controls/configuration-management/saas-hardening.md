# SaaS Hardening

Control for SaaS Hardening.

## Objective

Apply security configurations to SaaS applications to protect against unauthorized access and data leakage.

## Implementation

**SSO Enforcement**: All production SaaS apps require SSO login (no local passwords). **MFA Mandatory**: MFA enforced at IdP level for all users. **Session Timeouts**: Sessions expire after 8 hours of inactivity. **IP Restrictions**: Admin access to critical SaaS apps restricted to corporate IPs or VPN. **Data Loss Prevention**: CASB enforces DLP policies (block Confidential data uploads to unapproved apps). **Audit Logging**: Enable maximum audit logging retention in all SaaS apps. **Quarterly Reviews**: Review SaaS security settings, apply new hardening recommendations.

## Evidence

- SaaS SSO configuration screenshots
- IdP MFA enforcement policies
- Session timeout settings
