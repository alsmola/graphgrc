# Device Management (macOS MDM)

## Objective

Secure employee endpoints through centralized management.

## Description

All employee devices are managed through MDM. Security policies are enforced including disk encryption, screen lock, and automatic updates. Lost devices can be remotely wiped.

## Implementation

**MDM Solution**: Jamf Pro or Kandji for Mac management. All devices enrolled before provision to employee.

**Required Policies**: FileVault enabled, screen lock after 5 minutes, automatic updates enabled, malware protection installed.

**Compliance Monitoring**: MDM dashboard shows device compliance. Non-compliant devices flagged and user notified.

**Remote Wipe**: Lost or stolen device remotely wiped via MDM. Terminated employee devices wiped within 1 hour.

## Examples

- 100% of employee Macs enrolled in Jamf with FileVault enabled
- MDM enforces automatic macOS security updates within 7 days of release
- Lost laptop remotely wiped within 2 hours of employee report
- Non-compliant device blocked from network access until remediated

## Evidence

- MDM enrollment report showing all devices
- Device compliance dashboard
- Remote wipe logs
- MDM policy configuration
