# Software Updates

## Objective

Reduce vulnerability exposure through timely patching.

## Description

Operating systems and applications are kept up to date with security patches. Critical security updates are applied within 7 days. Patch status is monitored.

## Implementation

**Automatic Updates**: MDM policy enables automatic macOS security updates. Users cannot disable.

**Patch Schedule**: Critical security patches applied within 7 days. Other updates within 30 days.

**Application Updates**: Homebrew or automatic updaters for development tools. Security-critical apps (browsers) auto-update.

**Monitoring**: MDM dashboard shows OS version for all devices. Outdated devices flagged and users notified.

## Examples

- 95% of employee Macs on latest macOS version within 30 days of release
- Critical macOS security update deployed to all devices within 5 days
- Chrome browser automatically updates to latest version within 24 hours
- MDM report shows zero devices more than 60 days behind on patches

## Evidence

- MDM update policy configuration
- Device OS version report
- Patch deployment timeline for recent critical updates
- Update compliance dashboard
