# Endpoint Protection

## Objective

Protect endpoints from malware and data loss.

## Description

All endpoints run antivirus/anti-malware software. Full disk encryption is enabled. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities are deployed.

## Implementation

**Antivirus**: macOS built-in XProtect supplemented with CrowdStrike or SentinelOne for enhanced threat detection.

**Full Disk Encryption**: FileVault required on all Mac devices. Verified via MDM. Recovery keys escrowed to MDM.

**EDR**: CrowdStrike Falcon or SentinelOne for behavioral detection, threat hunting, and response.

**USB Restrictions**: USB storage blocked via MDM policy. Approved devices (Yubikey) allow-listed.

## Examples

- CrowdStrike deployed on all employee Macs with real-time protection
- FileVault enabled on 100% of devices, verified weekly via MDM report
- USB storage devices blocked - attempted use generates security alert
- CrowdStrike detected and quarantined malware from phishing email attachment

## Evidence

- Antivirus deployment status
- FileVault encryption status from MDM
- EDR agent deployment report
- Malware detection and remediation logs
