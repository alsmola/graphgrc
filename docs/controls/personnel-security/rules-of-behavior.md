Control for Rules of Behavior.

## Objective

## Implementation

**Acceptable Use Policy**: Documented rules covering device use, data handling, password management, physical security, incident reporting. **Annual Acknowledgment**: All employees acknowledge AUP annually via LMS. **Consequences**: Policy violations may result in disciplinary action up to termination. **Training**: Annual security awareness training reinforces rules of behavior. **Exceptions**: Exceptions require security team approval, documented justification, executive sign-off for material risks. **Updates**: AUP reviewed annually, updated based on new threats and technologies.
