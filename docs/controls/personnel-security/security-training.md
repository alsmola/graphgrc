# Security Training

All employees complete security awareness training upon hire and annually. Training covers phishing, password security, data handling, and incident reporting. Phishing simulations test effectiveness.

## Implementation

**Onboarding Training**: New hires complete security training in first week. Covers acceptable use, data classification, password policy, phishing.

**Annual Training**: All employees complete annual security training. Updated for current threats. Completion tracked in LMS.

**Phishing Simulations**: Quarterly simulated phishing campaigns. Employees who click get remedial training. Track click rate over time.

**Role-Specific**: Engineers get additional training on secure coding, OWASP Top 10. Support team trained on handling customer data.

## Examples

- 2024: 100% of employees completed annual security training
- Q4 2024 phishing simulation: 5% click rate (down from 15% in Q1)
- Engineering team completed secure coding training covering SQL injection, XSS
- New hire security training includes hands-on WebAuthn setup

## Evidence

- Security training curriculum
- Training completion reports
- Phishing simulation results
- Role-specific training records
