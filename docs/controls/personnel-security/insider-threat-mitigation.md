# Insider Threat Mitigation

Control for Insider Threat Mitigation.

## Objective

Detect and mitigate insider threats through monitoring, access controls, and awareness.

## Implementation

**User Behavior Analytics**: SIEM or UEBA tool monitors for anomalous activity (unusual access times, mass downloads, privilege escalation). **Least Privilege**: Users granted minimum necessary access, elevated access logged and time-bound. **DLP**: Data Loss Prevention blocks large data transfers to external storage. **HR Coordination**: HR notifies IT immediately of terminations or performance issues. **Separation of Duties**: Critical actions require two-person approval (production deployments, infrastructure changes). **Awareness**: Security training includes insider threat indicators, reporting suspicious behavior.

## Evidence

- UEBA alerts and investigations
- Least privilege access policies
- DLP policy configuration
- HR-IT coordination procedures
- Separation of duties matrix
