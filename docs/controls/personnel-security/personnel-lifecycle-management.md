# Personnel Lifecycle Management

Control for Personnel Lifecycle Management.

## Objective

Securely manage employee access throughout hire, change, and termination lifecycle.

## Implementation

**Onboarding**: New hire access provisioned via ServiceNow request, approved by manager, completed by IT. Background check completed before start date. Security training completed within first week. **Changes**: Access changes (promotions, team transfers) follow same request/approval workflow. **Offboarding**: Termination initiated in HRIS, triggers automated workflow: account deactivation within 1 hour (via SCIM), device remote wipe, access reviews to catch missed removals. **Auditing**: Quarterly access reviews validate all users have appropriate access.

## Evidence

- Access provisioning tickets
- Background check records
- Onboarding checklists
- Offboarding workflow logs
- Quarterly access review results
