# Encryption at Rest

Control for Encryption at Rest.

## Objective

Encrypt all Confidential and Restricted data at rest to protect against unauthorized access from storage compromise.

## Implementation

**Database Encryption**: RDS encryption enabled using AWS KMS customer-managed keys. **S3 Encryption**: SSE-KMS encryption required for all buckets containing Confidential data. **EBS Encryption**: All EBS volumes encrypted by default. **Encryption Standards**: AES-256-GCM encryption algorithm. **Key Rotation**: KMS automatic key rotation enabled (annual). **Backup Encryption**: All backups encrypted using same keys as source data.

## Evidence

- RDS encryption settings
- S3 bucket encryption policies
- EBS default encryption configuration
- KMS key rotation logs
- Encrypted backup verification
