# Code Signing

Control for Code Signing.

## Objective

Sign all software releases to ensure integrity and authenticity, preventing tampering or malware injection.

## Implementation

**Signing Keys**: Code signing certificates stored in secure key management service (AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault). **Build Pipeline**: CI/CD pipeline automatically signs artifacts during build process. **Certificate Management**: Code signing certificates renewed before expiration, rotated every 2 years. **Verification**: Release process verifies signatures before deployment. **Key Access**: Only automated build systems have signing key access (no developer access).

## Evidence

- Code signing certificates
- CI/CD signing configuration
- Signed artifact verification logs
- Certificate renewal records
- Key access audit logs
