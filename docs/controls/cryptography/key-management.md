# Key Management

Control for Key Management.

## Objective

Securely generate, store, rotate, and retire cryptographic keys following industry best practices.

## Implementation

**Key Storage**: AWS KMS for encryption keys, AWS Secrets Manager for API keys and credentials. **No Hardcoded Keys**: Automated scans (TruffleHog) detect hardcoded secrets in code. **Key Rotation**: KMS automatic rotation enabled annually. API keys rotated every 90 days. **Access Control**: Least privilege access to keys via IAM policies. **Audit Logging**: CloudTrail logs all key usage. **Key Lifecycle**: Retired keys maintained for decrypt-only access to historical data.

## Evidence

- AWS KMS key configuration
- Secrets Manager inventory
- Secret scanning tool reports
- Key rotation logs
- CloudTrail key usage logs
