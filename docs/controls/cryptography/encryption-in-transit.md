# Encryption in Transit

Control for Encryption in Transit.

## Objective

Encrypt all data in transit using TLS to prevent interception, eavesdropping, and man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Implementation

**TLS Requirements**: Minimum TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3 preferred. **Certificate Management**: AWS ACM manages certificates with automatic renewal. **HTTPS Only**: All public endpoints require HTTPS, HTTP redirects to HTTPS. **HSTS**: HTTP Strict Transport Security header enabled (max-age 1 year). **Internal Services**: Service-to-service communication uses TLS with mutual authentication where feasible. **API Security**: APIs enforce HTTPS, reject plain HTTP requests.

## Evidence

- ALB/CloudFront TLS configuration (TLS 1.2+ enforced)
- ACM certificate list and renewal status
- HSTS header configuration
- TLS connection logs
- API gateway HTTPS enforcement settings
