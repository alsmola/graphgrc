# Disaster Recovery

Control for Disaster Recovery.

## Objective

Ensure business continuity by maintaining tested disaster recovery capabilities with defined Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO).

## Implementation

**RTO/RPO Targets**: Production systems: RTO 4 hours, RPO 1 hour. **Multi-Region Architecture**: Primary region us-east-1, DR region us-west-2. **Data Replication**: RDS cross-region replicas, S3 cross-region replication enabled for critical buckets. **DR Runbooks**: Documented procedures for failover to DR region. **Annual DR Test**: Full failover test conducted annually, results documented, gaps remediated. **Backup Validation**: Monthly restore tests verify backup integrity.

## Evidence

- DR plan document with RTO/RPO targets
- Cross-region replication configuration
- DR runbooks
- Annual DR test reports
- Monthly backup restore test logs
