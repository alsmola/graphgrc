# Availability Monitoring

Control for Availability Monitoring.

## Objective

Continuously monitor system availability and performance to detect and respond to outages or degradations before customer impact.

## Implementation

**Uptime Monitoring**: External monitoring service (e.g., Pingdom, StatusCake) checks production endpoints every 1 minute from multiple geographic locations. **Application Monitoring**: APM tool (e.g., New Relic, Datadog) tracks application performance, error rates, and latency. **Infrastructure Monitoring**: CloudWatch monitors EC2, RDS, ELB health metrics with alerting on anomalies. **On-Call Rotation**: 24/7 on-call engineer receives alerts via PagerDuty. **Status Page**: Public status page (e.g., status.io) communicates availability to customers.

## Evidence

- Uptime monitoring reports (99.9% target)
- Application performance dashboards
- CloudWatch alarm history
- PagerDuty incident logs
- Status page incident timeline
