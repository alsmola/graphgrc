# Capacity Planning

Control for Capacity Planning.

## Objective

Proactively plan and provision capacity to maintain performance and availability as usage grows, preventing resource exhaustion.

## Implementation

**Usage Metrics**: Track CPU, memory, storage, network utilization across all production systems. **Growth Trends**: Quarterly analysis of growth rates (users, transactions, data volume). **Capacity Thresholds**: Alert when utilization exceeds 80% to trigger provisioning. **Auto-Scaling**: AWS Auto Scaling groups automatically add capacity during traffic spikes. **Annual Planning**: Engineering reviews capacity needs for next 12 months, budgets for infrastructure expansion.

## Evidence

- CloudWatch capacity utilization reports
- Quarterly capacity trend analysis
- Auto-scaling event logs
- Annual capacity planning documents
- Infrastructure budget approvals
