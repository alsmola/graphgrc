# Employee Personal Data

Control for Employee Personal Data.

## Objective

Protect employee personal data in compliance with privacy laws and maintain employee trust.

## Implementation

**HR System Security**: HRIS (BambooHR, Workday) with role-based access, MFA, audit logging. **Data Minimization**: Collect only employment-related personal data. **Access Restrictions**: HR team and employee's manager only. **Retention**: Terminated employee records retained 7 years per legal requirements, then deleted. **Employee Rights**: Employees can request access to their personal data. **Background Checks**: Consent obtained before background checks, results handled confidentially.

## Evidence

- HRIS access control configuration
- Employee data retention policies
- Employee data request logs
- Background check consent forms
- HR data access audit logs
