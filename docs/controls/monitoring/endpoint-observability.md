# Endpoint Observability

Control for Endpoint Observability.

## Objective

Monitor endpoint health, security posture, and user activity to detect threats and ensure compliance.

## Implementation

**EDR Telemetry**: Endpoint Detection and Response (CrowdStrike, SentinelOne) collects process execution, network connections, file changes. **MDM Monitoring**: MDM reports device compliance (encryption enabled, OS updated, firewall on). **Centralized Logging**: EDR and MDM logs forwarded to SIEM. **Alerting**: EDR alerts on suspicious activity (malware, lateral movement, privilege escalation). **Dashboards**: Security team monitors endpoint health dashboard daily. **Response**: Security team investigates EDR alerts within SLA (Critical: 1 hour, High: 4 hours).

## Evidence

- EDR deployment status (100% coverage)
- MDM compliance dashboards
- SIEM endpoint log integration
- EDR alert history
- Incident response tickets from endpoint alerts
