# Security Information and Events Management

Control for Security Information and Events Management.

## Objective

Centralize security event logs from all sources for correlation, alerting, and investigation.

## Implementation

**SIEM Platform**: Splunk, Elastic SIEM, or cloud-native (AWS Security Lake). **Log Sources**: CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, ALB logs, application logs, EDR, IdP auth logs, SaaS audit logs. **Correlation Rules**: Detect patterns indicating attacks (brute force, privilege escalation, data exfiltration). **Alerting**: Security team receives alerts for critical events via PagerDuty. **Retention**: 1 year online, 2 years archived (compliance requirement). **Daily Monitoring**: Security team reviews SIEM daily for anomalies.

## Evidence

- SIEM architecture diagram
- Log source inventory
- Correlation rule configurations
- SIEM alert history
- Daily SIEM review logs
