# Secure Coding Training

Control for Secure Coding Training.

## Objective

Train developers on secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities from being introduced in code.

## Implementation

**Annual Training**: All engineers complete secure coding training annually (e.g., OWASP Top 10, secure coding practices for languages used). **Onboarding**: New engineers complete training within first month. **Hands-On**: Training includes vulnerable code examples, remediation exercises. **Topics**: Input validation, authentication, authorization, cryptography, secrets management, OWASP Top 10. **Security Champions**: Advanced secure coding training for security champions. **Assessment**: Knowledge check at end of training, minimum 80% to pass. **Tracking**: LMS tracks completion, managers notified of non-compliance.

## Evidence

- Secure coding training materials
- Training completion reports (100% target)
- Training assessment scores
- Security champion advanced training
- LMS training records
