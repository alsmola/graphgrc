# Security Incident Response

Control for Security Incident Response.

## Objective

Detect, contain, investigate, and recover from security incidents to minimize impact and prevent recurrence.

## Implementation

**24/7 Monitoring**: SIEM and security alerts monitored continuously. **On-Call Rotation**: Security engineer on-call 24/7 via PagerDuty. **Severity Levels**: P0 (Critical - data breach, ransomware), P1 (High - system compromise), P2 (Medium - unsuccessful attack), P3 (Low - policy violation). **Response Steps**: Detect → Triage → Contain → Investigate → Remediate → Document → Post-Mortem. **Communication**: Security lead coordinates with engineering, legal, PR. **Documentation**: All incidents documented in ticketing system with timeline, actions, root cause, remediation.

## Evidence

- Incident response plan and runbooks
- On-call schedule
- Security incident tickets
- Incident response metrics (MTTI, MTTC)
- Post-mortem reports
