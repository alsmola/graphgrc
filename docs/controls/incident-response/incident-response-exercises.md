# Incident Response Exercises

Control for Incident Response Exercises.

## Objective

Test and improve incident response capabilities through regular tabletop exercises and simulations.

## Implementation

**Quarterly Tabletops**: Tabletop exercises with incident response team covering various scenarios (ransomware, data breach, DDoS, insider threat). **Scenario Design**: Realistic scenarios based on current threats and organizational risks. **Participants**: Security team, engineering on-call, IT ops, legal, PR/communications, executives. **Exercise Objectives**: Test communication, decision-making, playbook procedures. **Lessons Learned**: Document gaps, update runbooks, assign remediation tasks. **Annual Full Simulation**: Full incident response simulation with live system interaction.

## Evidence

- Quarterly tabletop exercise agendas and attendees
- Exercise scenario documents
- Lessons learned and action items
- Updated incident response runbooks
- Annual simulation reports
