## Objective

Respond to data breaches affecting personal data in compliance with breach notification laws (GDPR, state laws).

## Implementation

**Breach Definition**: Unauthorized access, disclosure, or loss of personal data. **Incident Classification**: Security incidents assessed for personal data impact. **Notification Timing**: GDPR requires notification to supervisory authority within 72 hours if high risk to individuals. **Affected Individuals**: Notify individuals without undue delay if high risk. **Documentation**: Breach register documents: date, scope, cause, impact, remediation, notifications sent. **Legal Review**: Legal counsel reviews breach notification requirements. **Annual Tabletop**: Conduct data breach response tabletop exercise annually.

## Evidence

- Data breach response plan
- Breach notification templates
- Breach register
- Regulatory breach notifications sent
- Tabletop exercise documentation
