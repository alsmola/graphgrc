# Change Management

## Objective

Minimize risk from production changes through controlled processes.

## Description

Changes to production systems follow a defined process. Changes are reviewed, tested, and approved. Emergency changes are documented after the fact. Rollback procedures are in place.

## Implementation

**Change Process**: All production changes require GitHub pull request with peer review. Terraform changes require approval from senior engineer.

**Testing**: Changes deployed to staging environment first. Automated tests must pass. Manual QA sign-off for risky changes.

**Change Window**: Standard changes deployed during business hours. High-risk changes during maintenance window with customer notice.

**Emergency Changes**: Allowed for critical security/availability issues. Post-mortem required within 48 hours.

## Examples

- All infrastructure changes require Terraform PR with two approvals
- Application deployed to staging, passes automated tests, then promoted to production
- Database schema change tested in staging, deployed during maintenance window
- Emergency patch deployed for critical vulnerability, post-mortem completed next day

## Evidence

- Change management procedure
- GitHub pull request history showing reviews and approvals
- Deployment logs with timestamps
- Emergency change post-mortems
