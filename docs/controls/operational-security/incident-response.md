# Incident Response

## Objective

Respond effectively to security incidents and minimize impact.

## Description

Security incident response procedures are documented and tested. Incidents are detected, contained, and remediated. Post-incident reviews are conducted. Incidents are reported as required by regulation.

## Implementation

**Detection**: AWS GuardDuty, CloudWatch alarms, CrowdStrike EDR generate alerts. Employee reporting via security@company.com.

**Response Process**: Incident severity classification (P0-P3). On-call engineer paged for P0/P1. Incident commander assigned. War room (Slack/Zoom).

**Containment**: Isolate affected systems. Revoke compromised credentials. Preserve evidence for investigation.

**Post-Incident**: Post-incident review (PIR) within 5 days for P0/P1. Document findings, root cause, action items. Track remediation.

## Examples

- GuardDuty detected compromised EC2 instance, paged on-call, instance isolated within 15 minutes
- Phishing email reported by employee, security team investigated and blocked sender
- Quarterly tabletop exercise practiced ransomware response
- 2024: 12 security incidents, all with completed PIRs and remediation action items

## Evidence

- Incident response policy and runbooks
- Incident log with severity, timeline, resolution
- Post-incident review documents
- Tabletop exercise documentation
