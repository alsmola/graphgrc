# Vulnerability Management

## Objective

Identify and remediate security vulnerabilities before exploitation.

## Description

Systems are regularly scanned for vulnerabilities. Critical vulnerabilities are patched within 30 days. Penetration testing is conducted annually. Vulnerability management process is documented.

## Implementation

**Vulnerability Scanning**: AWS Inspector scans EC2 instances and containers for vulnerabilities. Dependency scanning in GitHub for application code.

**Patching SLA**: Critical vulnerabilities patched within 7 days. High within 30 days. Medium within 90 days.

**Penetration Testing**: Annual external penetration test by qualified third party. Findings remediated based on severity.

**Bug Bounty**: Public bug bounty program for security researchers. Valid findings remediated and researcher rewarded.

## Examples

- AWS Inspector scans all production EC2 instances weekly
- Dependabot creates PRs for vulnerable npm packages, merged within 5 days
- 2024 annual penetration test found 2 medium findings, both remediated within 30 days
- Bug bounty program paid out 3 researchers in 2024 for valid security findings

## Evidence

- Vulnerability scan results
- Vulnerability remediation timeline
- Annual penetration test report
- Bug bounty program results
