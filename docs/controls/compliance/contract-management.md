# Contract Management

Control for Contract Management.

## Objective

Ensure all vendor contracts include appropriate security, privacy, and compliance requirements to protect organizational and customer data.

## Implementation

**Contract Templates**: Legal maintains standard templates with required security clauses (confidentiality, data protection, audit rights, incident notification). **Security Review**: Security team reviews contracts for SaaS vendors handling Confidential or Restricted data. **DPAs Required**: Data Processing Agreements mandatory for vendors processing customer personal data. **SOC 2 Attestation**: Vendors processing Confidential data must provide SOC 2 Type II report. **Contract Repository**: All signed contracts stored in CLM system with renewal date tracking.

## Evidence

- Contract templates with security clauses
- Security contract review records
- Signed DPAs with vendors
- Vendor SOC 2 reports
- Contract management system records
