# Internal Audits

Control for Internal Audits.

## Objective

Validate security control effectiveness through regular internal testing, identifying gaps before external audits.

## Implementation

**Quarterly Testing**: Internal audit of key controls: access reviews, change management, vulnerability patching, training completion, log monitoring. **Test Procedures**: Sample-based testing following external audit methodology. **Documentation**: Test results documented in audit workpapers with screenshots, log exports, signed attestations. **Gap Remediation**: Identified gaps assigned to control owners with due dates. **Pre-Audit Readiness**: Internal audit conducted 1-2 months before external audit to identify and fix issues.

## Evidence

- Quarterly internal audit workpapers
- Control testing results
- Gap remediation tracking
- Internal audit reports
- Pre-audit readiness assessments
