# Documentation Review

Control for Documentation Review.

## Objective

Maintain current, accurate security documentation through regular review cycles to ensure policies and procedures reflect actual practices.

## Implementation

**Review Cadence**: Policies (annual), Standards (annual), Processes (annual), Controls (quarterly). **Owner Assignment**: Each document has designated owner responsible for reviews. **Review Process**: Owner reviews content, updates as needed, signs off on completion. **Change Tracking**: Git tracks all documentation changes with commit messages explaining rationale. **Approval Workflow**: Material policy changes require executive sponsor approval.
