# Vulnerability Management Process

Control for Vulnerability Management Process.

## Objective

Establish systematic process for identifying, prioritizing, and remediating vulnerabilities across all systems.

## Implementation

**Continuous Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning (AWS Inspector, EDR, dependency scanning) runs continuously. **Centralized Tracking**: Vulnerabilities tracked in GRC tool or ticketing system. **Risk-Based Prioritization**: Prioritize by CVSS score, exploitability, asset criticality, data sensitivity. **SLAs**: Critical 7 days, High 30 days, Medium 90 days. **Ownership**: Vulnerabilities assigned to responsible teams (engineering, IT, security). **Metrics Dashboard**: Track open vulns by severity, MTTR, SLA compliance. **Quarterly Reviews**: Security Committee reviews vulnerability trends, addresses recurring issues.

## Evidence

- Vulnerability scanning configuration
- Vulnerability tracking database
- Remediation SLA compliance reports
- Vulnerability metrics dashboard
