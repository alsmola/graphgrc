# Vulnerability Management Process

Control for Vulnerability Management Process.

## Objective

Establish systematic process for identifying, prioritizing, and remediating vulnerabilities across all systems.

## Implementation

**Continuous Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning (AWS Inspector, EDR, dependency scanning) runs continuously. **Centralized Tracking**: Vulnerabilities tracked in GRC tool or ticketing system. **Risk-Based Prioritization**: Prioritize by CVSS score, exploitability, asset criticality, data sensitivity. **SLAs**: Critical 7 days, High 30 days, Medium 90 days. **Ownership**: Vulnerabilities assigned to responsible teams (engineering, IT, security). **Metrics Dashboard**: Track open vulns by severity, MTTR, SLA compliance. **Quarterly Reviews**: Security Committee reviews vulnerability trends, addresses recurring issues.

## Evidence

- Vulnerability scanning configuration
- Vulnerability tracking database
- Remediation SLA compliance reports
- Vulnerability metrics dashboard
- Quarterly vulnerability management reviews

**Standards:**
- [standard-vulnerability-management: Vulnerability Management Standard](../../standards/vulnerability-management-standard.md) ^[CVSS v3.1 severity-based remediation SLAs: Critical (7 days), High (30 days), Medium (90 days), triage within 48 hours]

**Processes:**
- [External Audit](../../processes/external-audit.md) ^[Monthly vulnerability scans provided as audit evidence]
- [Internal Audit](../../processes/internal-audit.md) ^[Internal audit tests vulnerability remediation within SLA]
- [penetration testing](../../processes/penetration-testing.md) ^[Pentest findings triaged by CVSS severity, remediation within standard SLAs (Critical: 7d, High: 30d)]
- [security alert triage](../../processes/security-alert-triage.md) ^[Vulnerability scanner findings triaged separately from security alerts]

**Policies:**
- [Engineer Security Policy](../../policies/engineer.md) ^[Review dependencies before adding, keep up to date, scan for vulnerabilities, document license compatibility]
- [Engineering Security Policy](../../policies/engineering-security-policy.md) ^[Address Critical/High severity vulnerabilities within SLA, review dependencies before adding, keep dependencies up to date]
- [Security Team Policy](../../policies/security-team.md) ^[Triage vulnerabilities and assign remediation owners, track remediation progress]

**Charter:**
- [Governance](../../charter/governance.md) ^[MTTR targets by severity: Critical <7d, High <30d, Medium <90d, open Critical/High target 0/5]
