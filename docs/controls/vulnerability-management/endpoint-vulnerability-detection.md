# Endpoint Vulnerability Detection

Control for Endpoint Vulnerability Detection.

## Objective

Identify vulnerabilities and missing patches on endpoint devices to maintain secure configurations.

## Implementation

**Patch Management**: MDM (Jamf, Intune) reports installed OS versions and patch levels. **Vulnerability Scanning**: EDR or vulnerability scanner identifies missing patches and vulnerable software. **Patch SLAs**: Critical OS patches within 7 days, high within 30 days. **Automated Patching**: MDM can push critical patches automatically after testing. **Application Updates**: Monitor for vulnerable applications (browsers, productivity software), notify users to update. **Compliance Reporting**: Weekly reports on endpoint patch compliance, escalate non-compliant devices.

## Evidence

- MDM patch compliance reports
- Vulnerability scan results
- Patch deployment logs
- Patch compliance metrics by severity
- Non-compliant device escalations
