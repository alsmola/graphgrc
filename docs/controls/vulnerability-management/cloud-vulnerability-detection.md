# Cloud Vulnerability Detection

Control for Cloud Vulnerability Detection.

## Objective

Continuously identify vulnerabilities in cloud infrastructure through automated scanning and configuration assessments.

## Implementation

**AWS Inspector**: Scans EC2 instances for vulnerabilities, checks against CVEs and CIS benchmarks. **Config Rules**: AWS Config checks for misconfigurations (S3 public access, unencrypted storage, excessive permissions). **Security Hub**: Aggregates findings from Inspector, Config, and other sources. **Severity Scoring**: CVSS scores prioritize remediation (Critical: ≥9.0, High: 7.0-8.9). **SLAs**: Critical vulns fixed within 7 days, high within 30 days, medium within 90 days. **Quarterly Reviews**: Review vulnerability trends, update scanning coverage.

## Evidence

- AWS Inspector scan results
- Config rule compliance reports
- Security Hub findings dashboard
- Vulnerability remediation tracking
- Vulnerability management metrics
