# SaaS Threat Detection

Control for SaaS Threat Detection.

## Objective

Detect threats and anomalies in SaaS application usage through CASB and SaaS security tools.

## Implementation

**CASB**: Cloud Access Security Broker (Netskope, Zscaler) monitors SaaS usage, detects anomalies. **Anomaly Detection**: Alert on unusual behavior (login from new country, mass downloads, sharing data externally). **Shadow IT**: CASB discovers unauthorized SaaS apps. **DLP**: Data Loss Prevention policies block uploads of Confidential data to unapproved apps. **OAuth Monitoring**: Monitor OAuth grants, revoke suspicious third-party app access. **Threat Intelligence**: CASB incorporates threat intel to block access to malicious sites. **Response**: Security team investigates alerts, works with users to remediate.

## Evidence

- CASB deployment and configuration
- Anomaly detection alerts and investigations
- Shadow IT discovery reports
- DLP policy violations
- OAuth app reviews and revocations
