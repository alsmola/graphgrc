# Cloud Threat Detection

Control for Cloud Threat Detection.

## Objective

Detect malicious activity in cloud environments using threat intelligence and behavioral analysis.

## Implementation

**AWS GuardDuty**: Continuously monitors VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail, DNS logs for threats (compromised instances, reconnaissance, unauthorized access). **Alerts**: GuardDuty findings sent to Security Hub and SIEM, critical alerts to PagerDuty. **Threat Intelligence**: GuardDuty uses AWS threat intelligence feeds and custom threat intel. **Response**: Security team investigates alerts within SLA (Critical: 1 hour, High: 4 hours). **Automated Remediation**: Lambda functions auto-remediate common issues (isolate compromised instance, block malicious IPs). **Quarterly Review**: Review GuardDuty findings, tune detection rules to reduce false positives.

## Evidence

- GuardDuty enabled in all regions and accounts
- GuardDuty findings and remediation actions
- SIEM integration logs
- Threat detection SLA compliance
- Quarterly threat detection reviews
