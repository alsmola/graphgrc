# Endpoint Threat Detection

Control for Endpoint Threat Detection.

## Objective

Detect and respond to malware, ransomware, and other threats on endpoint devices.

## Implementation

**EDR**: Endpoint Detection and Response (CrowdStrike Falcon, SentinelOne) deployed on all endpoints. **Real-Time Protection**: Antivirus, behavior monitoring, exploit prevention, ransomware protection. **Threat Hunting**: EDR enables proactive threat hunting queries across all endpoints. **Automated Response**: EDR can automatically isolate compromised endpoints. **SIEM Integration**: EDR alerts forwarded to SIEM for correlation with other security events. **24/7 Monitoring**: Security team monitors EDR console, receives critical alerts. **Metrics**: Track malware detections, response time, false positive rate.

## Evidence

- EDR deployment coverage (100% target)
- Malware detection and remediation logs
- Threat hunting query results
- Endpoint isolation events
- EDR alert response metrics
