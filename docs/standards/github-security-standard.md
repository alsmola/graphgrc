# GitHub Security Standard

Baseline security requirements for GitHub organizations and repositories.

## Scope

All repositories in the organization's GitHub organization(s).

## Requirements

### Organization Settings

- Require 2FA for all organization members
- Restrict repository creation to admins
- Enable Dependency Graph and Dependabot alerts
- Enable Secret Scanning (GitHub Advanced Security)
- Default repository permission: Read (not Write)

### Repository Protection

- Require branch protection on `main`/`master`:
  - Require pull request reviews (minimum 1 approval)
  - Require status checks to pass
  - Require conversation resolution before merge
  - No force pushes or deletions
- Protected branches cannot be bypassed by admins
- Enable "Require signed commits" for sensitive repos

### Access Control

- Use GitHub Teams for access management (not individual invites)
- Follow least privilege: Read by default, Write when needed, Admin sparingly
- External collaborators must be approved by security team
- Quarterly access reviews of organization members

### Secrets Management

- No secrets in code (enforced by pre-commit hooks and secret scanning)
- Use GitHub Actions secrets for CI/CD credentials
- Rotate secrets when team members leave
- Use environment protection rules for production deployments

### CI/CD Security

- GitHub Actions:
  - Pin actions to SHA (not tags)
  - No secrets in PR builds from forks
  - Use OIDC for cloud provider authentication (not long-lived keys)
  - Require workflow approval for first-time contributors
- Third-party integrations require security review

### Audit and Monitoring

- Enable audit log streaming to SIEM
- Alert on sensitive actions: member added, permissions changed, secrets accessed
- Review security advisories weekly
