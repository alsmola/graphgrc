# SaaS IAM Standard

Identity and access management requirements for SaaS applications.

## Scope

All third-party SaaS applications used by employees (Slack, GitHub, AWS, Google Workspace, etc.).

## Requirements

### Single Sign-On (SSO)

- All SaaS applications must support SSO integration (SAML/OIDC)
- Use centralized identity provider (Okta, Google Workspace, Azure AD)
- Provision users via SSO, no local accounts
- Exceptions require security team approval (document in vendor assessment)

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- MFA required for all SaaS applications
- Enforced at IdP level (not application level)
- Acceptable factors: Authenticator app (TOTP), hardware keys (FIDO2/WebAuthn)
- Prohibited: SMS, email-based OTP (unless no other option available)

### Provisioning and Deprovisioning

- Automated user provisioning via SCIM where supported
- For non-SCIM apps: API-based automation or manual provisioning documented
- Deprovisioning triggered by HR offboarding, completed within 1 hour
- Quarterly access reviews to identify orphaned accounts

### Access Control

- Role-based access control (RBAC) configured in each SaaS app
- Default to least privilege (Viewer/Read-only)
- Elevated permissions require manager approval
- Admin accounts limited to IT/Security teams

### Session Management

- Maximum session lifetime: 12 hours for standard users, 1 hour for admins
- Re-authenticate for sensitive actions (payment, config changes)
- Idle timeout: 30 minutes

### Audit Logging

- Enable audit logging in all SaaS applications
- Forward logs to centralized SIEM where possible
- Retain logs for minimum 1 year (2 years for SOC 2 compliance)
- Monitor for anomalous access: unusual location, failed auth attempts, permission changes

## Inventory Management

- Maintain inventory of all approved SaaS applications (IT asset management system)
- Shadow IT detection via SSO logs and network monitoring
- Quarterly review of SaaS inventory
