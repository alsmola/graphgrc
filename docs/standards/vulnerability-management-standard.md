# Vulnerability Management Standard

Requirements for identifying, assessing, and remediating security vulnerabilities.

## Scope

All systems, applications, infrastructure, and dependencies.

## Vulnerability Scanning

### Scanning Requirements

- **Application dependencies:** Automated scanning on every PR (Dependabot, Snyk)
- **Container images:** Scan before deployment (ECR scan, Trivy)
- **Infrastructure:** Weekly scans of AWS resources (Prowler, AWS Inspector)
- **Web applications:** Quarterly authenticated scans (OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite)
- **External attack surface:** Monthly scans of public endpoints

### Scan Coverage

- Production and staging environments
- Third-party dependencies (npm, pip, Go modules)
- Infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, CloudFormation)
- Docker base images

## Severity Classification

Align with CVSS v3.1 scoring:

- **Critical (9.0-10.0):** Fix within 7 days
- **High (7.0-8.9):** Fix within 30 days
- **Medium (4.0-6.9):** Fix within 90 days
- **Low (0.1-3.9):** Fix opportunistically or accept risk

### Exceptions

Production systems with public exposure escalate severity by one level (High → Critical).

## Remediation Process

1. **Automated alerts** to engineering team via Slack/PagerDuty
2. **Triage:** Assess exploitability and business impact within 48 hours
3. **Patch or mitigate:** Update dependency, apply vendor patch, or implement compensating control
4. **Verify fix:** Re-scan to confirm remediation
5. **Document exception** if accepting risk (requires security team approval)

## Patch Management

### Operating System Patches

- macOS endpoints: Auto-update enabled, enforced by MDM
- AWS Linux instances: Automated patching with SSM Patch Manager
- Critical security patches applied within 7 days of release

### Application Dependencies

- Automated dependency updates via Dependabot/Renovate
- Review and merge within SLA based on severity
- Pin direct dependencies, update transitive dependencies regularly

## Third-Party Software

- Vendor-managed SaaS: Rely on vendor patching (verify in security assessment)
- Self-hosted software: Subscribe to security advisories, apply patches within SLA
