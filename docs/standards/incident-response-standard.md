# Incident Response Standard

Requirements for detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents.

## Scope

All security incidents affecting confidentiality, integrity, or availability of systems or data.

## Incident Severity Levels

### Severity 1 (Critical)

- Active data breach or confirmed unauthorized access to Confidential/Restricted data
- Ransomware or destructive malware
- Complete service outage affecting all customers
- Response time: Immediate (page on-call)

### Severity 2 (High)

- Suspected data breach under investigation
- Successful phishing with credential compromise
- Vulnerability actively being exploited
- Partial service outage
- Response time: Within 1 hour

### Severity 3 (Medium)

- Security policy violation
- Malware detected and contained
- Vulnerability discovered (not exploited)
- Failed intrusion attempt
- Response time: Within 4 hours

### Severity 4 (Low)

- Suspicious activity (false positive likely)
- Policy violation with minimal risk
- Response time: Within 24 hours

## Detection Methods

- Automated alerts from monitoring systems (GuardDuty, SIEM)
- User reports (phishing, suspicious activity)
- Third-party notification (vendor, researcher)
- Security scanning and audits

## Response Requirements

### Immediate Actions

1. **Contain:** Isolate affected systems, revoke compromised credentials
2. **Assess:** Determine scope and severity
3. **Notify:** Alert security team, page on-call if Sev 1/2
4. **Document:** Create incident ticket with timeline

### Investigation

- Collect logs and forensic evidence before remediation
- Identify root cause and entry vector
- Determine data/systems impacted
- Preserve evidence for potential legal action

### Remediation

- Remove attacker access
- Patch vulnerabilities
- Restore from clean backups if needed
- Reset credentials for affected systems/users

### Communication

- **Internal:** Notify leadership, affected teams
- **External:** Notify customers if data breach (see data-breach-response-process.md)
- **Regulatory:** GDPR breach notification within 72 hours if applicable

### Post-Incident

- Document lessons learned
- Update runbooks and detections
- Implement preventive controls
- Security team reviews within 7 days

## Evidence Retention

- All incident artifacts retained for 7 years
- Chain of custody maintained for forensic evidence

## Testing

- Tabletop exercises: Quarterly
- Simulated incident response: Annually
