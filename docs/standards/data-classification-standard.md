# Data Classification Standard

Defines how to classify data based on sensitivity and required protection levels.

## Scope

All data created, processed, stored, or transmitted by the organization.

## Classification Levels

### Public

**Definition:** Information intended for public consumption.

**Examples:** Marketing materials, published blog posts, public documentation

**Requirements:**
- No access restrictions required
- Can be shared freely

### Internal

**Definition:** Information for internal business use, not sensitive.

**Examples:** Project plans, internal wikis, company announcements, source code

**Requirements:**
- Accessible to employees only
- Do not share outside the organization without approval
- OK to store in SaaS tools (Slack, Google Workspace)

### Confidential

**Definition:** Sensitive business or customer information that could cause harm if disclosed.

**Examples:** Customer PII (names, emails, addresses), financial data, contracts, security assessments, non-public product roadmaps

**Requirements:**
- Encrypt at rest and in transit
- Access logged and monitored
- Access based on role/need-to-know
- Cannot be stored on local laptops (use cloud storage only)
- Do not share in Slack/email without encryption
- Annual access reviews required

### Restricted

**Definition:** Highly sensitive data with regulatory requirements or severe impact if disclosed.

**Examples:** Payment card data (PCI), health information (HIPAA), passwords/secrets, cryptographic keys, social security numbers, authentication tokens

**Requirements:**
- All Confidential requirements plus:
- Encrypt with KMS customer-managed keys
- MFA required for access
- Quarterly access reviews
- Cannot be logged or transmitted to third-party services
- Must be stored in approved systems only (no general-purpose databases)

## Labeling Requirements

- AWS resources: Use `DataClassification` tag
- S3 buckets: Bucket name or tag indicates classification
- Documentation: Header or filename indicates classification
