# SOC2 - CC7.1
**To meet its objectives, the entity uses detection and monitoring procedures to identify (1) changes to configurations that result in the introduction of new vulnerabilities, and (2) susceptibilities to newly discovered vulnerabilities**
## Uses Defined Configuration Standards
Management has defined configuration standards
## Monitors Infrastructure and Software
The entity monitors infrastructure and software for noncompliance with the standards, which could threaten the achievement of the entity's objectives
## Implements Change-Detection Mechanisms
The IT system includes a change-detection mechanism (for example, file integrity monitoring tools) to alert personnel to unauthorized modifications of critical system files, configuration files, or content files
## Detects Unknown or Unauthorized Components
Procedures are in place to detect the introduction of unknown or unauthorized components
## Conducts Vulnerability Scans
The entity conducts vulnerability scans designed to identify potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations on a periodic basis and after any significant change in the environment and takes action to remediate identified deficiencies on a timely basis.
