**The entity implements logical access security measures to protect against threats from sources outside its system boundaries**
Restricts Access — The types of activities that can occur through a communication channel (for example, FTP site, router port) are restricted. Protects Identification and Authentication Credentials — Identification and authentication credentials are protected during transmission outside its system boundaries.. Requires Additional Authentication or Credentials — Additional authentication information or credentials are required when accessing the system from outside its boundaries..
