# SCF - AST-04 - Network Diagrams & Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)
Mechanisms exist to maintain network architecture diagrams that: 
 - Contain sufficient detail to assess the security of the network's architecture;
 - Reflect the current architecture of the network environment; and
 - Document all sensitive/regulated data flows.
