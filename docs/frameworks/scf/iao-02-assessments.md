# SCF - IAO-02 - Assessments
Mechanisms exist to formally assess the cybersecurity & data privacy controls in systems, applications and services through Information Assurance Program (IAP) activities to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting expected requirements.
## Mapped framework controls
### ISO 27002
- [A.5.21](../iso27002/a-5.md#a521)
- [A.5.23](../iso27002/a-5.md#a523)
- [A.8.29](../iso27002/a-8.md#a829)
  
### NIST 800-53
- [CA-2](../nist80053/ca-2.md)
  
### SOC 2
- [CC4.1](../soc2/cc41.md)
  
## Control questions
Does the organization formally assess the cybersecurity & data privacy controls in systems, applications and services through Information Assurance Program (IAP) activities to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting expected requirements?
