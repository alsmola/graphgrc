# SCF - NET-02 - Layered Network Defenses
Mechanisms exist to implement security functions as a layered structure that minimizes interactions between layers of the design and avoids any dependence by lower layers on the functionality or correctness of higher layers. 
## Mapped framework controls
### ISO 27002
- [A.8.20](../iso27002/a-8.md#a820)
  
### SOC 2
- [CC6.6](../soc2/cc66.md)
  
## Control questions
Does the organization implement security functions as a layered structure that minimizes interactions between layers of the design and avoids any dependence by lower layers on the functionality or correctness of higher layers?
