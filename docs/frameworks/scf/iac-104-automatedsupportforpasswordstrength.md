# SCF - IAC-10.4 - Automated Support For Password Strength
Automated mechanisms exist to determine if password authenticators are sufficiently strong enough to satisfy organization-defined password length and complexity requirements. 
## Framework Mappings
### NIST 800-53
- [IA-5(1)](../nist80053/ia-5-1.md)
## Control Questions
Does the organization use automated mechanisms to determine if password authenticators are sufficiently strong enough to satisfy organization-defined password length and complexity requirements?
