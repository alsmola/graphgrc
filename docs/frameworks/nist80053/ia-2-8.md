# NIST 800-53v5 - IA-2.8 - Access to Accounts — Replay Resistant
## Guidance
Authentication processes resist replay attacks if it is impractical to achieve successful authentications by replaying previous authentication messages. Replay-resistant techniques include protocols that use nonces or challenges such as time synchronous or cryptographic authenticators.
