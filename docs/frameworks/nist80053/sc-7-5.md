# NIST 800-53v5 - SC-7.5 - Deny by Default — Allow by Exception
- 
## Guidance
Denying by default and allowing by exception applies to inbound and outbound network communications traffic. A deny-all, permit-by-exception network communications traffic policy ensures that only those system connections that are essential and approved are allowed. Deny by default, allow by exception also applies to a system that is connected to an external system.
