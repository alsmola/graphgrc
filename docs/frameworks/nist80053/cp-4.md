# NIST 800-53v5 - CP-4 - Contingency Plan Testing
- Test the contingency plan for the system \[ Assignment: frequency \] using the following tests to determine the effectiveness of the plan and the readiness to execute the plan: {{ insert: param, cp-4_prm_2 }}.
- Review the contingency plan test results; and
- Initiate corrective actions, if needed.
- 
## Guidance
Methods for testing contingency plans to determine the effectiveness of the plans and identify potential weaknesses include checklists, walk-through and tabletop exercises, simulations (parallel or full interrupt), and comprehensive exercises. Organizations conduct testing based on the requirements in contingency plans and include a determination of the effects on organizational operations, assets, and individuals due to contingency operations. Organizations have flexibility and discretion in the breadth, depth, and timelines of corrective actions.
