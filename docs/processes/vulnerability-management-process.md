# Vulnerability Management Process

Process for identifying, triaging, and remediating security vulnerabilities.

## Roles and Responsibilities

- **Security Team:** Coordinates scanning, triages findings, tracks remediation
- **Engineering Team:** Remediates application and dependency vulnerabilities
- **Infrastructure Team:** Remediates infrastructure and OS vulnerabilities

## Prerequisites

- Vulnerability scanning tools configured (Dependabot, Snyk, AWS Inspector, etc.)
- SLA defined for each severity level (see vulnerability-management-standard.md)
- Vulnerability tracking system (Jira, GitHub Issues, etc.)

## Process Steps

### Step 1: Automated Scanning

Vulnerability scanners run automatically on schedule or per event.

**Scanning types:**
- **Dependency scanning:** On every PR (Dependabot, Snyk)
- **Container scanning:** On every image push (ECR scan, Trivy)
- **Infrastructure scanning:** Weekly (Prowler, AWS Inspector)
- **Web application scanning:** Quarterly (OWASP ZAP)
- **External attack surface:** Monthly (Shodan, Censys)

**Owner:** Automated systems
**Duration:** Continuous

### Step 2: Alert and Notification

Vulnerabilities detected trigger alerts to appropriate teams.

**Notification routing:**
- Critical/High: Slack #security-alerts + email to security team
- Medium: Daily digest to security team
- Low: Weekly report

**Alert includes:**
- CVE ID and description
- CVSS score and severity
- Affected system/component
- Remediation guidance (patch version, configuration change)

**Owner:** Automated systems
**Duration:** Real-time or batched

### Step 3: Triage and Prioritization

Security team reviews findings and prioritizes based on risk.

**Triage criteria:**
- CVSS score (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Exploitability (is exploit public? Is it being actively exploited?)
- Exposure (is system public-facing or internal?)
- Data sensitivity (does system handle Confidential/Restricted data?)
- Business criticality

**Actions:**
- Assign severity (may escalate from scanner severity based on context)
- Create remediation ticket
- Assign to owning team
- Set due date based on SLA

**Owner:** Security Team
**Duration:** Within 48 hours of detection

### Step 4: Risk Assessment (for exceptions)

If remediation is not feasible, team requests risk exception.

**Exception scenarios:**
- No patch available yet
- Patch breaks functionality (requires testing)
- Compensating controls in place (WAF rule, network isolation)
- False positive

**Process:**
- Team documents justification in ticket
- Security team reviews and approves/denies
- If approved: Document compensating controls, set re-review date

**Owner:** Owning team (request), Security team (approval)
**Duration:** Within 5 business days

### Step 5: Remediation

Owning team fixes vulnerability within SLA.

**Remediation actions:**
- Update dependency to patched version
- Apply OS/software patch
- Change configuration (disable vulnerable feature)
- Implement compensating control

**Best practices:**
- Test patch in staging before production
- Automated dependency updates via Dependabot/Renovate where possible
- Document changes in ticket

**Owner:** Engineering Team or Infrastructure Team
**Duration:** Based on severity SLA (see vulnerability-management-standard.md)

### Step 6: Verification

Security team verifies remediation is complete.

**Verification methods:**
- Re-run vulnerability scan
- Check software version/configuration
- Review audit logs for successful patch deployment

**Actions:**
- If fixed: Close ticket
- If not fixed or introduces new issues: Reopen ticket, work with team on alternative

**Owner:** Security Team
**Duration:** Within 48 hours of remediation claim

### Step 7: Metrics and Reporting

Security team tracks vulnerability management metrics.

**Metrics:**
- Mean Time to Remediate (MTTR) by severity
- Number of open vulnerabilities by severity
- SLA compliance rate
- Number of exceptions granted
- Vulnerabilities introduced vs. resolved (trend)

**Reporting:** Monthly report to leadership, quarterly deep dive

**Owner:** Security Team
**Duration:** Monthly

## SLA Tracking

Automated alerts for vulnerabilities approaching SLA deadline:
- 50% of SLA time elapsed: Warning notification
- 75% of SLA time elapsed: Escalate to team lead
- 100% of SLA time elapsed: Escalate to engineering manager

## Exception Reviews

All risk exceptions reviewed quarterly:
- Has patch become available?
- Are compensating controls still in place?
- Should exception be extended or vulnerability fixed?

## Validation and Evidence

- Vulnerability scan reports
- Remediation tickets with timestamps
- Risk exception approvals
- Re-scan verification results
- MTTR metrics dashboard
