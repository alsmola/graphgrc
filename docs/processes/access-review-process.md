# Access Review Process

Quarterly review of user access to ensure access remains appropriate and follows least privilege.

## Roles and Responsibilities

- **Security Team:** Coordinates reviews, generates reports, tracks completion
- **Managers:** Review and certify team member access
- **IT Team:** Remediates access issues identified in reviews

## Prerequisites

- Up-to-date employee roster in HRIS
- Audit logs from all systems (SSO, AWS, GitHub, etc.)
- Access review scheduled in security team calendar

## Process Steps

### Step 1: Generate Access Reports

Security team generates access reports from all systems.

**Reports include:**
- SSO: User accounts and group memberships
- AWS IAM Identity Center: Permission sets assigned to each user
- GitHub: Organization membership and team assignments
- SaaS applications: User lists and roles
- Privileged access: Admin accounts across all systems

**Owner:** Security Team
**Duration:** 2-3 days before review start

### Step 2: Distribute to Managers

Security team sends access reports to each manager for their direct reports.

**Delivery method:** Secure shared document or dedicated access review tool
**Instructions:** Review each team member, confirm access is appropriate, flag any issues

**Owner:** Security Team
**Duration:** First day of review period (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)

### Step 3: Manager Review

Each manager reviews access for their direct reports.

**Review criteria:**
- Does employee still need access to this system?
- Is the level of access appropriate for their current role?
- Any unused accounts or permissions to remove?
- Any missing access that should be added?

**Actions:**
- Mark each user as "Approved" or "Needs Change"
- Document required changes
- Sign/date attestation

**Owner:** Managers
**Duration:** 10 business days

### Step 4: Remediation

IT team processes requested changes from managers.

**Actions:**
- Remove access for terminated employees (should already be done, but verify)
- Downgrade excessive permissions
- Remove inactive accounts (no login in 90 days)
- Document all changes in access review tracker

**Owner:** IT Team
**Duration:** 5 business days after manager review complete

### Step 5: Privileged Access Deep Dive

Security team performs detailed review of all admin/privileged accounts.

**Focus areas:**
- AWS admin roles
- GitHub organization owners
- SaaS application admins
- Database admin accounts
- Production system access

**Review:** Verify business justification, check for unused privileged accounts

**Owner:** Security Team
**Duration:** 3-5 days

### Step 6: Report and Document

Security team compiles summary report of access review.

**Report includes:**
- Number of users reviewed
- Number of access changes made
- Manager attestation completion rate
- Orphaned accounts removed
- Exceptions and open items

**Owner:** Security Team
**Duration:** 2 days

## Validation and Evidence

- Access reports from each system (exported before and after remediation)
- Manager attestations (signed/dated)
- Access review summary report
- Remediation tickets and audit logs

## Exception Handling

- **Manager non-responsive:** Escalate to manager's manager, security team reviews and makes decisions
- **Shared accounts:** Document as exception, plan migration to individual accounts
- **Service accounts:** Reviewed separately by engineering/infrastructure teams

## Quarterly Schedule

- **Q1 (January):** Full access review
- **Q2 (April):** Full access review
- **Q3 (July):** Full access review
- **Q4 (October):** Full access review + annual deep dive
