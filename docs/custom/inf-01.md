# INF-01: Cloud Security Configuration (AWS)
## Objective
Maintain secure AWS infrastructure configuration.



## Description
AWS infrastructure follows security best practices. Security Groups, NACLs, and IAM policies are configured with least privilege. Infrastructure as Code is used for consistent secure configurations.



## Implementation Details

**Network Segmentation**: Production VPC separate from development. Public subnets for load balancers, private subnets for application/database.

**Security Groups**: Default deny all inbound. Explicit allow rules for necessary traffic. No 0.0.0.0/0 for sensitive ports.

**Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform for all infrastructure. Peer review required. Terraform state in encrypted S3 with DynamoDB locking.

**AWS Config**: Enabled in all regions. Rules check for security misconfigurations (unencrypted resources, public S3 buckets, etc.).



## Examples
- Production RDS databases in private subnet, not internet-accessible
- Security groups allow only necessary ports (443 for HTTPS, 5432 for Postgres)
- AWS Config rule alerts when S3 bucket becomes public
- All infrastructure changes require Terraform PR with security review



## Audit Evidence
- Network architecture diagram
- Terraform code repository
- AWS Config compliance dashboard
- Security group rules audit
