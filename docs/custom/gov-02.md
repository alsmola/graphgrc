## Implementation Details

**Annual Risk Assessment**: Formal risk assessment conducted annually. Identify threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, impact.

**Risk Register**: Maintain risk register with identified risks, risk ratings, treatment plans, owners.

**Risk Treatment**: For each risk, document treatment (mitigate, accept, transfer, avoid). Track remediation actions.
