# ACC-04: Privileged Access Management
## Objective
Protect critical systems through enhanced controls on privileged accounts.



## Description
Administrative and privileged access is tightly controlled, monitored, and audited. Break-glass procedures exist for emergency access.



## Implementation Details

**Admin Accounts**: Separate admin accounts (admin@) from regular user accounts. MFA required for all admin access.

**AWS Root Account**: Root account MFA enabled with hardware token. Root credentials stored in physical safe. Access requires two executives.

**Session Recording**: All privileged sessions recorded using AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch Logs.

**Break Glass**: Emergency access procedures documented. Break-glass account usage triggers alert to security team and CEO.



## Examples
- AWS root account credentials locked in company safe, requires CEO + CFO
- All admin actions logged to immutable S3 bucket with CloudTrail
- Engineers use elevated privileges via AWS SSO with automatic 4-hour timeout
- Break-glass account last used 6 months ago during critical outage, fully documented



## Audit Evidence
- Privileged account inventory
- AWS CloudTrail logs for admin actions
- Break-glass procedure documentation
- Physical safe access log for root credentials

### SOC 2
- [CC6.2](../frameworks/soc2/cc62.md) - Tightly controlling privileged access ensures only authorized users can perform administrative functions
- [CC6.8](../frameworks/soc2/cc68.md) - Restricting privileged access and session recording supports detection and investigation of unauthorized actions
- [CC7.2](../frameworks/soc2/cc72.md) - Monitoring and alerting on privileged account usage detects anomalies indicative of malicious acts

### GDPR
- [Article 32](../frameworks/gdpr/art32.md) - Enhanced controls on privileged access (MFA, monitoring, break-glass procedures) ensure security appropriate to high risk
- [Article 5](../frameworks/gdpr/art5.md) - Limiting and auditing privileged access supports accountability principle for data processing
