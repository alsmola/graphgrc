# OPS-04: Business Continuity
## Objective
Ensure business operations can continue during disruptions.



## Description
Business continuity and disaster recovery plans are documented and tested. Critical systems have defined RTO and RPO. Failover procedures are tested. Alternative processing sites are available.



## Implementation Details

**BC/DR Plan**: Written plan covering key scenarios (data center outage, natural disaster, cyber attack). Roles and responsibilities defined.

**RTO/RPO Targets**: Production database RTO 4 hours, RPO 1 hour. Application servers RTO 2 hours (auto-scaling).

**AWS Multi-Region**: Critical services can failover to alternate AWS region. Route53 health checks enable automatic failover.

**Annual Testing**: BC/DR plan tested annually via tabletop or live failover exercise. Plan updated based on findings.



## Examples
- Production database has multi-AZ deployment with automatic failover
- Route53 configured to failover to us-west-2 if us-east-1 unhealthy
- Annual DR test failed over production to alternate region, verified RTO target met
- Communications plan includes customer notification templates for major outages



## Audit Evidence
- Business continuity plan
- RTO/RPO definitions for critical systems
- Annual BC/DR test results
- Multi-region architecture diagram
