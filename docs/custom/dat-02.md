# DAT-02: Encryption
## Objective
Protect data confidentiality through cryptographic controls.



## Description
All data is encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2+. Sensitive data is encrypted at rest using AES-256. Encryption keys are managed through AWS KMS.



## Implementation Details

**In Transit**: All external APIs use HTTPS with TLS 1.2+. Internal services use TLS for inter-service communication. No plaintext protocols.

**At Rest**: S3 buckets use SSE-KMS encryption. RDS databases use encryption at rest. EBS volumes encrypted.

**Key Management**: AWS KMS for encryption keys. Keys rotated annually. Access to keys controlled via IAM.

**Endpoints**: macOS FileVault full disk encryption required on all employee devices.



## Examples
- All S3 buckets have default encryption enabled with AWS KMS
- RDS instances configured with encryption at rest using customer managed KMS keys
- Application enforces TLS 1.2 minimum, TLS 1.0/1.1 disabled
- All employee MacBooks have FileVault enabled and verified quarterly



## Audit Evidence
- S3 bucket encryption settings
- RDS encryption configuration
- TLS configuration for load balancers/applications
- MDM reports showing FileVault status on all devices

## Framework Mapping

<!-- This section is used to generate backlinks from framework controls to this custom control. Do not remove. -->

### SOC 2
- [CC6.1](../frameworks/soc2/cc61.md) - Encryption at rest and in transit protects information assets from unauthorized access during storage and transmission
- [CC6.7](../frameworks/soc2/cc67.md) - TLS encryption restricts and protects transmission, movement, and removal of information

### GDPR
- [Article 32](../frameworks/gdpr/art32.md) - Encryption of personal data is explicitly listed as an appropriate technical measure to ensure security of processing
- [Article 34](../frameworks/gdpr/art34.md) - Encryption can reduce breach notification requirements - encrypted data may not require notification to data subjects
