# END-02: Endpoint Protection
## Objective
Protect endpoints from malware and data loss.



## Description
All endpoints run antivirus/anti-malware software. Full disk encryption is enabled. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities are deployed.



## Implementation Details

**Antivirus**: macOS built-in XProtect supplemented with CrowdStrike or SentinelOne for enhanced threat detection.

**Full Disk Encryption**: FileVault required on all Mac devices. Verified via MDM. Recovery keys escrowed to MDM.

**EDR**: CrowdStrike Falcon or SentinelOne for behavioral detection, threat hunting, and response.

**USB Restrictions**: USB storage blocked via MDM policy. Approved devices (Yubikey) allow-listed.



## Examples
- CrowdStrike deployed on all employee Macs with real-time protection
- FileVault enabled on 100% of devices, verified weekly via MDM report
- USB storage devices blocked - attempted use generates security alert
- CrowdStrike detected and quarantined malware from phishing email attachment



## Audit Evidence
- Antivirus deployment status
- FileVault encryption status from MDM
- EDR agent deployment report
- Malware detection and remediation logs

### SOC 2
- [CC6.8](../frameworks/soc2/cc68.md) - EDR and antivirus protect endpoints from malicious software and unauthorized modifications
- [CC7.2](../frameworks/soc2/cc72.md) - EDR continuously monitors endpoints for anomalies indicative of malicious acts

### GDPR
- [Article 32](../frameworks/gdpr/art32.md) - Endpoint protection (EDR, antivirus, encryption, USB restrictions) are technical measures ensuring security of processing
