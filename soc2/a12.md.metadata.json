        "summary": "Measures Current Usage - The use of the system components is measured to establish a baseline for capacity management and to use when evaluating the risk of impaired availability due to capacity constraints. Forecasts Capacity - The expected average and peak use of system components is forecasted and compared to system capacity and associated tolerances. Forecasting considers capacity in the event of the failure of system components that constrain capacity. Makes Changes Based on Forecasts - The system change management process is initiated when forecasted usage exceeds capacity tolerances."
