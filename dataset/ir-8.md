# NIST 800-53v5 - IR-8 - Incident Response Plan
- Develop an incident response plan that:
- Distribute copies of the incident response plan to \[ Assignment: incident response personnel \];
- Update the incident response plan to address system and organizational changes or problems encountered during plan implementation, execution, or testing;
- Communicate incident response plan changes to \[ Assignment: organization-defined incident response personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and organizational elements \] ; and
- Protect the incident response plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.

## Guidance
It is important that organizations develop and implement a coordinated approach to incident response. Organizational mission and business functions determine the structure of incident response capabilities. As part of the incident response capabilities, organizations consider the coordination and sharing of information with external organizations, including external service providers and other organizations involved in the supply chain. For incidents involving personally identifiable information (i.e., breaches), include a process to determine whether notice to oversight organizations or affected individuals is appropriate and provide that notice accordingly.
