# NIST 800-53v5 - AC-17.3 - Managed Access Control Points
## Guidance
Organizations consider the Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) initiative [DHS TIC](#4f42ee6e-86cc-403b-a51f-76c2b4f81b54) requirements for external network connections since limiting the number of access control points for remote access reduces attack surfaces.
