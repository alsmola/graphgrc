# NIST 800-53v5 - CM-3.2 - Testing, Validation, and Documentation of Changes
## Guidance
Changes to systems include modifications to hardware, software, or firmware components and configuration settings defined in [CM-6](#cm-6) . Organizations ensure that testing does not interfere with system operations that support organizational mission and business functions. Individuals or groups conducting tests understand security and privacy policies and procedures, system security and privacy policies and procedures, and the health, safety, and environmental risks associated with specific facilities or processes. Operational systems may need to be taken offline, or replicated to the extent feasible, before testing can be conducted. If systems must be taken offline for testing, the tests are scheduled to occur during planned system outages whenever possible. If the testing cannot be conducted on operational systems, organizations employ compensating controls.
