# NIST 800-53v5 - AC-17.1 - Monitoring and Control
## Guidance
Monitoring and control of remote access methods allows organizations to detect attacks and help ensure compliance with remote access policies by auditing the connection activities of remote users on a variety of system components, including servers, notebook computers, workstations, smart phones, and tablets. Audit logging for remote access is enforced by [AU-2](#au-2) . Audit events are defined in [AU-2a](#au-2_smt.a).
