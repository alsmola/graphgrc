# NIST 800-53v5 - AC-2.2 - Automated Temporary and Emergency Account Management
## Guidance
Management of temporary and emergency accounts includes the removal or disabling of such accounts automatically after a predefined time period rather than at the convenience of the system administrator. Automatic removal or disabling of accounts provides a more consistent implementation.
