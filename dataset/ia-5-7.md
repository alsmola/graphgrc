# NIST 800-53v5 - IA-5.7 - No Embedded Unencrypted Static Authenticators
- 
## Guidance
In addition to applications, other forms of static storage include access scripts and function keys. Organizations exercise caution when determining whether embedded or stored authenticators are in encrypted or unencrypted form. If authenticators are used in the manner stored, then those representations are considered unencrypted authenticators.
