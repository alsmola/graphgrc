| Not performed              | There is no evidence of a capability to identify and document Standardized Operating Procedures (SOP), or similar documentation, to enable the proper execution of day-to-day / assigned tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Performed internally       | Security Operations (OPS) efforts are ad hoc and inconsistent. CMM Level 1 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- Cybersecurity operations are decentralized.<br>- The responsibility for developing and operating cybersecurity & data privacy procedures are up to the business process owner(s) to determine, including the definition and enforcement of roles and responsibilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Planned and tracked        | Security operations (OPS) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- Security operations management is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.<br>- IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for security operations.<br>- Administrative processes focus on protecting High Value Assets (HVAs), including environments where sensitive/regulated data is stored, transmitted and processed.<br>- Critical business functions are documented in “run books” or Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) to capture operational knowledge in documentation form.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Well defined               | Security Operations (OPS) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- A Security Operations Center (SOC), or similar function, manages cybersecurity operations that covers preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication and recovery.<br>- Procedures are standardized across the enterprise to ensure uniformity and consistent execution. These Standardized Operating Procedures (SOP) identify and document day-to-day procedures to enable the proper execution of assigned tasks.<br>- Line of Business (LOB) stakeholders are identified and tasked with documenting business-critical functions in “run books,” or SOPs, to capture the knowledge in documentation form from both a business and technology perspective.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Quantitatively controllled | Security Operations (OPS) efforts are metrics driven and provide sufficient management insight (based on a quantitative understanding of process capabilities) to predict optimal performance, ensure continued operations and identify areas for improvement. In addition to CMM Level 3 criteria, CMM Level 4 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).<br>- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs).<br>- 	Scope of metrics, KPIs and KRIs covers organization-wide cybersecurity & data privacy controls, including functions performed by third-parties.<br>- 	Organizational leadership maintains a formal process to objectively review and respond to metrics, KPIs and KRIs (e.g., monthly or quarterly review).<br>- 	Based on metrics analysis, process improvement recommendations are submitted for review and are handled in accordance with change control processes.<br>- 	Both business and technical stakeholders are involved in reviewing and approving proposed changes. |
| Continuously improving     | See SP-CMM4. SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to identify and document Standardized Operating Procedures (SOP), or similar documentation, to enable the proper execution of day-to-day / assigned tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
