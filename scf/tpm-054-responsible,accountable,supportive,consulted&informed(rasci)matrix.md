# SCF - %!S(string=TPM-05.4 - Responsible, Accountable, Supportive, Consulted & Informed (RASCI) Matrix)
Mechanisms exist to document and maintain a Responsible, Accountable, Supportive, Consulted & Informed (RASCI) matrix, or similar documentation, to delineate assignment for cybersecurity & data privacy controls between internal stakeholders and External Service Providers (ESPs). 
## Mapped framework controls
### ISO 27001
- [4.3.c](../iso27001/4.md#43c)
### ISO 27002
- [A.5.23](../iso27002/a-5.md#a523)
## Control questions
Does the organization document and maintain a Responsible, Accountable, Supportive, Consulted & Informed (RASCI) matrix, or similar documentation, to delineate assignment for cybersecurity & data privacy controls between internal stakeholders and External Service Providers (ESPs)?
