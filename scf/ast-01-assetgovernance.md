| Well defined               | Asset Management (AST) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), or similar function, analyzes the organization’s business strategy and prioritizes the objectives of the security function to determine prioritized and authoritative guidance for asset management practices, within the broader scope of cybersecurity and data protection operations.<br>- The CISO, or similar function, develops a security-focused Concept of Operations (CONOPS) that documents management, operational and technical measures to apply defense-in-depth techniques across the organization. This CONOPS for asset management may be incorporated as part of a broader operational plan for the cybersecurity & data privacy program.<br>- A Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) function, or similar function, provides governance oversight for the implementation of applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual cybersecurity & data privacy controls to facilitate the implementation of secure and compliant practices to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability and safety of the organization’s applications, systems, services and data. Compliance requirements for data backups are identified and documented.<br>- A steering committee is formally established to provide executive oversight of the cybersecurity & data privacy program, including asset management. The steering committee establishes a clear and authoritative accountability structure for asset management operations.<br>- An IT Asset Management (ITAM) function, or similar function, governs asset management to help ensure compliance with requirements for asset management.<br>- An ITAM function, or similar function, maintains an inventory of IT assets, covering both physical and virtual assets, as well as centrally managed asset ownership assignments.<br>- An ITAM function, or similar function, conducts ongoing “technical debt” reviews of hardware and software technologies to remediate outdated and/ or unsupported technologies.<br>- Technology assets and data are categorized according to data classification and business criticality criteria.<br>- A Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) function oversees supply chain risks including the removal and prevention of certain technology services and/ or equipment designated as supply chain threats by a statutory or regulatory body.<br>- Data/process owners document where sensitive/regulated data is stored, transmitted and processed, generating Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) and network diagrams to document the flow of data.<br>- Anti-theft software is installed on laptops and mobile devices to track assets removal from facilities. If possible, alerting is enabled for sensitive/regulated assets.<br>- Technologies are configured to protect data with the strength and integrity commensurate with the classification or sensitivity of the information and conform to industry-recognized standards for hardening (e.g., DISA STIGs, CIS Benchmarks or OEM security guides), including cryptographic protections for sensitive/regulated data.<br>- The Human Resources (HR) department ensures that every user accessing a system that processes, stores, or transmits sensitive/regulated data is cleared and regularly trained in proper data handling practices.  |
