| Performed internally       | Cybersecurity & Privacy Governance (GOV) efforts are ad hoc and inconsistent. CMM Level 1 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- No formal cybersecurity and/ or data privacy principles are identified for the organization.<br>- No formal Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) team exists. GRC roles are assigned to existing IT/cybersecurity personnel.<br>- Governance efforts are narrowly-limited to certain compliance requirements.<br>- Formal roles and responsibilities for cybersecurity and/ or data privacy may exist.<br>- Cybersecurity and data privacy governance is informally assigned as an additional duty to existing IT/cybersecurity personnel.<br>- Basic cybersecurity policies and standards are documented [not based on any industry framework]<br>- Basic procedures are established for important tasks, but are ad hoc and not formally documented.<br>- Documentation is made available to internal personnel.<br>- Organizational leadership maintains an informal process to review and respond to observed trends.<br>- Cybersecurity personnel identify and maintain contact information for local and national law enforcement (e.g., FBI field office) in case of cybersecurity incidents that require law enforcement involvement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Planned and tracked        | Cybersecurity & Privacy Governance (GOV) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- Cybersecurity and data privacy governance activities are decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.<br>- IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are appropriate to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for cybersecurity & data privacy governance activities.<br>- The Chief Information Officer (CIO), or similar function, analyzes the organization’s business strategy and prioritizes the objectives of the security function, based on business requirements.<br>- A qualified individual is assigned the role and responsibilities to centrally manage, coordinate, develop, implement and maintain a cybersecurity & data privacy program (e.g., cybersecurity director or Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)).<br>- No formal Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) team exists. GRC roles are assigned to existing cybersecurity personnel.<br>- Compliance requirements for cybersecurity & data privacy are identified and documented.<br>- Cybersecurity policies and standards exist that are aligned with a leading cybersecurity framework (e.g., SCF, NIST 800-53, ISO 27002 or NIST Cybersecurity Framework).<br>- Controls are assigned to sensitive/regulated assets to comply with specific compliance requirements.<br>- Procedures are established for sensitive/regulated obligations, but are not standardized across the organization. <br>- Documentation is made available to internal personnel.<br>- Incident response personnel identify and maintain contact information for local and national law enforcement (e.g., FBI field office) in case of cybersecurity incidents that require law enforcement involvement.<br>- Contact information is verified and updated on at least an annual basis. |
| Well defined               | Cybersecurity & Privacy Governance (GOV) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- A Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) function, or similar function, provides scoping guidance to determine control applicability.<br>- Compliance requirements for cybersecurity & data privacy controls are identified, documented and tested for adherence to internal standards or regulatory requirements. <br>- Procedures are established for sensitive/regulated obligations and standardized across the organization. <br>- Controls are standardized across the organization to ensure uniformity and consistent execution.<br>- Internal policies and standards address all statutory, regulatory and contractual obligations for cybersecurity & data privacy.<br>- Defined roles & responsibilities require data/process owners to define, implement and maintain cybersecurity & data privacy controls for each system, application and/ or service of which they have accountability.<br>- Incident response personnel identify and maintain contact information for local and national law enforcement (e.g., FBI field office) in case of cybersecurity incidents that require law enforcement involvement.<br>- Contact information is verified and updated on at least an annual basis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
