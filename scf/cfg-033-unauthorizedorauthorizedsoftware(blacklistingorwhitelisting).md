# CFG-03.3 - Unauthorized or Authorized Software (Blacklisting or Whitelisting)
Mechanisms exist to whitelist or blacklist applications in an order to limit what is authorized to execute on systems.
## Mapped framework controls

## Control questions
Does the organization whitelist or blacklist applications in an order to limit what is authorized to execute on systems?
