# SCF - GOV-07 - Contacts With Groups & Associations
Mechanisms exist to establish contact with selected groups and associations within the cybersecurity & data privacy communities to: 
 - Facilitate ongoing cybersecurity & data privacy education and training for organizational personnel;
 - Maintain currency with recommended cybersecurity & data privacy practices, techniques and technologies; and
 - Share current cybersecurity and/or data privacy-related information including threats, vulnerabilities and incidents.

## Control questions
Does the organization establish contact with selected groups and associations within the cybersecurity & data privacy communities to: 
 - Facilitate ongoing cybersecurity & data privacy education and training for organizational personnel;
 - Maintain currency with recommended cybersecurity & data privacy practices, techniques and technologies; and
 - Share current cybersecurity and/or data privacy-related information including threats, vulnerabilities and incidents?

| Performed internally       | Cybersecurity & Privacy Governance (GOV) efforts are ad hoc and inconsistent. CMM Level 1 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- No formal cybersecurity and/ or data privacy principles are identified for the organization.<br>- No formal Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) team exists. GRC roles are assigned to existing IT/cybersecurity personnel.<br>- Governance efforts are narrowly-limited to certain compliance requirements.<br>- Formal roles and responsibilities for cybersecurity and/ or data privacy may exist.<br>- Cybersecurity and data privacy governance is informally assigned as an additional duty to existing IT/cybersecurity personnel.<br>- Basic cybersecurity policies and standards are documented [not based on any industry framework]<br>- Basic procedures are established for important tasks, but are ad hoc and not formally documented.<br>- Documentation is made available to internal personnel.<br>- Organizational leadership maintains an informal process to review and respond to observed trends.<br>- Cybersecurity and data privacy personnel identify and maintain contact information for local, regional and national cybersecurity / data privacy groups and associations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

GRC roles are assigned to existing cybersecurity personnel.<br>- Compliance requirements for cybersecurity & data privacy are identified and documented.<br>- Cybersecurity policies and standards exist that are aligned with a leading cybersecurity framework (e.g., SCF, NIST 800-53, ISO 27002 or NIST Cybersecurity Framework).<br>- Controls are assigned to sensitive/regulated assets to comply with specific compliance requirements.<br>- Procedures are established for sensitive/regulated obligations, but are not standardized across the organization. <br>- Documentation is made available to internal personnel.<br>- Cybersecurity and data privacy personnel identify and maintain contact information for local, regional and national cybersecurity / data privacy groups and associations.<br>- Cybersecurity and data privacy personnel in supervisory positions subscribe to news feeds from groups and associations to facilitate ongoing education and training. |
