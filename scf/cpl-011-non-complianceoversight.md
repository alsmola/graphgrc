## Control questions
Does the organization document and review instances of non-compliance with statutory, regulatory and/or contractual obligations to develop appropriate risk mitigation actions?

| Planned and tracked        | Compliance (CPL) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- Compliance activities are decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.<br>- IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are appropriate to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for compliance activities.<br>- Cybersecurity personnel use a defined set of controls to conduct cybersecurity & data privacy control assessments, as defined by the applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements.<br>- Legal representation is consulted on an as-needed basis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
