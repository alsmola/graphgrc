Local/regional practices fall under the broader enterprise-wide technology asset maintenance program.<br>- Facilities management uses an enterprise-wide process to facilitate the secure and timely implementation of non-IT maintenance operations, including preventative and reactionary maintenance operations. Local/regional practices fall under the broader enterprise-wide facilities management program.<br>- A Change Control Board (CCB), or similar function, centrally manages the process of IT and non-IT maintenance operations to reduce the chance of business interruptions from maintenance operations.  |
| Quantitatively controllled | Maintenance (MNT) efforts are metrics driven and provide sufficient management insight (based on a quantitative understanding of process capabilities) to predict optimal performance, ensure continued operations and identify areas for improvement. In addition to CMM Level 3 criteria, CMM Level 4 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).<br>- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs).<br>- 	Scope of metrics, KPIs and KRIs covers organization-wide cybersecurity & data privacy controls, including functions performed by third-parties.<br>- 	Organizational leadership maintains a formal process to objectively review and respond to metrics, KPIs and KRIs (e.g., monthly or quarterly review).<br>- 	Based on metrics analysis, process improvement recommendations are submitted for review and are handled in accordance with change control processes.<br>- 	Both business and technical stakeholders are involved in reviewing and approving proposed changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to develop, disseminate, review & update procedures to facilitate the implementation of maintenance controls across the enterprise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
