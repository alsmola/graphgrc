CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- A Validated Architecture Design Review (VADR) evaluates Internet-facing design criteria for secure practices and conformance with requirements for applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual controls to determine if the system/application/service is designed, built and operated in a secure and resilient manner.<br>- A change notification capability exists to scan web pages for changes, which are reviewed by appropriate personnel to determine if changes are authorized or unuathorized.<br>- Ongoing content reviews are performed to ensure web pages do not contain non-public information.<br>- Security engineering, or a similar function, ensures that Internet-facing devices conform to industry-recognized standards for configuration hardening (e.g., DISA STIGs, CIS Benchmarks or OEM security guides) for test, development, staging and production environments. This includes creating special hardening requirements for High-Value Assets (HVAs).<br>- An Identity & Access Management (IAM) function, or similar function, enables the implementation of identification and access management controls for Internet-facing technologies. <br>- Technologies are configured to implement Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) for consumers to prove their identity.<br>- Administrative processes exist and technologies are configured to provide Internet-facing individuals (e.g., customers, users, clients, etc.) with clear and precise information about cookies, in accordance with regulatory requirements for cookie management.<br>- An IT Asset Management (ITAM) function, or similar function, categorizes network devices according to the data the asset stores, transmits and/ or processes and applies the appropriate technology controls to protect the asset and data.<br>- Boundary protections:<br>o	Utilize Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) to provide defense-in-depth protection for application-specific threats. <br>o	Restrict inbound traffic to authorized devices on certain services, protocols and ports. |
