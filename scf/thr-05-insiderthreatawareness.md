| Not performed              | There is no evidence of a capability to utilize security awareness training on recognizing and reporting potential indicators of insider threat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Performed internally       | Threat Management (THR) efforts are ad hoc and inconsistent. CMM Level 1 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- Threat management is decentralized. <br>- IT personnel subscribe to threat feeds to maintain situational awareness of emerging threats.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Planned and tracked        | Threat Management (THR) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- Threat management is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.<br>- The HR department, in conjunction with cybersecurity personnel, helps ensure secure practices are implemented in personnel management operations to help manage threats.<br>- IT/cybersecurity personnel:<br>o	Identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are appropriate to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for threat management.<br>o	Subscribe to threat feeds to maintain situational awareness of emerging threats.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Well defined               | Threat Management (THR) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- A Security Operations Center (SOC), or similar function:<br>o	Subscribes to threat feeds to maintain situational awareness of emerging threats.<br>o	Develops Indicators of Exposure (IOE) to better understand potential attack vectors that attackers could use to attack the organization. <br>o	Implements a Threat Awareness Program (TAP) that includes a cross-organization information-sharing capability. <br>o	Implements a “threat hunting” capability to actively identify internal threats.<br>- An Integrated Security Incident Response Team (ISIRT), or similar function, exists to form an on-demand, integrated team of cybersecurity, IT, data privacy and business function representatives that can execute coordinated incident response operations, including a cross-discipline incident handling capability.<br>- Cybersecurity personnel enable security awareness training on recognizing and reporting potential indicators of insider threat. |
| Quantitatively controllled | Threat Management (THR) efforts are metrics driven and provide sufficient management insight (based on a quantitative understanding of process capabilities) to predict optimal performance, ensure continued operations and identify areas for improvement. In addition to CMM Level 3 criteria, CMM Level 4 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).<br>- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs).<br>- 	Scope of metrics, KPIs and KRIs covers organization-wide cybersecurity & data privacy controls, including functions performed by third-parties.<br>- 	Organizational leadership maintains a formal process to objectively review and respond to metrics, KPIs and KRIs (e.g., monthly or quarterly review).<br>- 	Based on metrics analysis, process improvement recommendations are submitted for review and are handled in accordance with change control processes.<br>- 	Both business and technical stakeholders are involved in reviewing and approving proposed changes.                                                           |
| Continuously improving     | See SP-CMM4. SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to utilize security awareness training on recognizing and reporting potential indicators of insider threat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
