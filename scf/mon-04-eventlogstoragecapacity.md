| Planned and tracked        | Continuous Monitoring (MON) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- Situational awareness management is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.<br>- Secure baseline configurations generate logs that contain sufficient information to establish necessary details of activity and allow for forensics analysis.<br>- IT/cybersecurity personnel:<br>o	Identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are appropriate to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for situational awareness management.<br>o	Configure alerts for critical or sensitive data that is stored, transmitted and processed on assets.<br>o	Use a structured process to review and analyze logs.<br>- A log aggregator, or similar automated tool, provides an event log report generation capability to aid in detecting and assessing anomalous activities on business-critical systems.                                                                                              |
| Well defined               | Continuous Monitoring (MON) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- An IT Asset Management (ITAM) function, or similar function:<br>o	Governs asset management that ensures compliance with requirements for asset management.<br>o	Leverages a Configuration Management Database (CMDB), or similar tool, as the authoritative source of IT assets.<br>- A Security Incident Event Manager (SIEM), or similar automated tool:<br>o	Centrally collects logs and is protected according to the manufacturerâ€™s security guidelines to protect the integrity of the event logs with cryptographic mechanisms.<br>o	Monitors the organization for Indicators of Compromise (IoC) and provides 24x7x365 near real-time alerting capability.<br>o	Is configured to alert incident response personnel of detected suspicious events such that incident responders can look to terminate suspicious events.<br>- Both inbound and outbound network traffic is monitored for unauthorized activities to identify prohibited activities and assist incident handlers with identifying potentially compromised systems.  |
| Quantitatively controllled | Continuous Monitoring (MON) efforts are metrics driven and provide sufficient management insight (based on a quantitative understanding of process capabilities) to predict optimal performance, ensure continued operations and identify areas for improvement. In addition to CMM Level 3 criteria, CMM Level 4 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).<br>- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs).<br>- 	Scope of metrics, KPIs and KRIs covers organization-wide cybersecurity & data privacy controls, including functions performed by third-parties.<br>- 	Organizational leadership maintains a formal process to objectively review and respond to metrics, KPIs and KRIs (e.g., monthly or quarterly review).<br>- 	Based on metrics analysis, process improvement recommendations are submitted for review and are handled in accordance with change control processes.<br>- 	Both business and technical stakeholders are involved in reviewing and approving proposed changes.                                                                                                                         |
