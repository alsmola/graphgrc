# SCF - MDM-01 - Centralized Management Of Mobile Devices
Mechanisms exist to develop, govern & update procedures to facilitate the implementation of mobile device management controls.
## Mapped framework controls
### ISO 27002
- [A.8.1](../iso27002/a-8.md#a81)
### SOC 2
- [CC6.7](../soc2/cc67.md)
## Control questions
Does the organization develop, govern & update procedures to facilitate the implementation of mobile device management controls?
