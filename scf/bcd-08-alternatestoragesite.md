| Planned and tracked        | Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery (BCD) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- Business Continuity / Disaster Recovery (BC/DR) management is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.<br>- IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are appropriate to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for BC/DR management.<br>- BC/DR roles are formally assigned as an additional duty to existing IT/cybersecurity personnel.<br>- Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) identify business-critical systems and services, which are given priority of service in alternate processing and storage sites.<br>- IT personnel develop Disaster Recovery Plans (DRP) to recover business-critical systems and services.<br>- Data/process owners conduct a Business Impact Analysis (BIA) at least annually, or after any major technology or process change, to identify assets critical to the business in need of protection, as well as single points of failure.<br>- IT/cybersecurity personnel work with business stakeholders to develop Business Continuity Plans (BCPs) to ensure business functions are sustainable both during and after an incident within Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs).<br>- IT personnel use a backup methodology (e.g., grandfather, father & s on rotation) to store backups in a secondary location, separate from the primary storage site.<br>- IT personnel configure business-critical systems to transfer backup data to the alternate site at a rate that is capable of meeting Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs).<br>- the organization acquires space to serve as the alternate site that is in a different geographic zone from the inaccessible facility (e.g., dedicated facility or cloud instance).Roles and responsibilities are formally assigned to restore the primary site in the event of a catastrophe, emergency, or similar-type disruptive incident in accordance with the Continuity of Operations (COOP) plan.<br>- IT personnel backup copies of business-critical software, licenses/keys and other security-related information to the alternate site.<br>- IT personnel configure business-critical systems to be able to failover to an alternate location than the primary system which can be activated without loss of information or disruption to operations.<br>- A dedicated alternate site is identified, documented, equipped to match the processing capabilities of the primary site and not used for existing production activities .<br>- IT personnel maintain network connectivity for data communications from the alternate site toother business critical locations in order to support business processes.<br>- IT personnel maintain redundant network connectivity from the alternate site to the business locations providing the ability for data communications to support business processes.<br>- IT personnel maintain technologies compatible with existing network and infrastructure configuration. the organization either owns the facility or contracts with a third-party provider for off-site storage. |
