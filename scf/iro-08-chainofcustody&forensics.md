| Planned and tracked        | Incident Response (IRO) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- Incident response operations are decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.<br>- IT/cybersecurity personnel:<br>o	Identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are appropriate to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for incident response operations. <br>o	Implement and maintain an incident response capability using a documented and tested Incident Response Plan (IRP) to facilitate incident management operations that cover preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication and recovery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Well defined               | Incident Response (IR) processes are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- An Integrated Security Incident Response Team (ISIRT), or similar function, exists to form an on-demand, scalable and integrated team of formally-assigned cybersecurity, IT, data privacy and business function representatives that can perform coordinated incident response.<br>- The ISIRT, or similar function, develops and maintains a documented, program-level Integrated Incident Response Program (IIRP) that provides operational and tactical-level guidance for cybersecurity & data privacy response operations.<br>- A Security Operations Center (SOC), or similar function, facilitates incident management operations that includes preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication and recovery.<br>- Business Process Owners (BPOs), in conjunction with the SOC and ISIRT functions, develop and maintain a documented Incident Response Plan (IRP) specific to the business process / business unit but inclusive of the organizationâ€™s larger approach to incident response operations.<br>- An IT Asset Management (ITAM) function, or similar function, categorizes endpoint devices according to the data the asset stores, transmits and/ or processes and provides that information to the SOC for Incident Response Operations (IRO). |
