| Not performed              | There is no evidence of a capability to protect wireless access via secure authentication and encryption.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Performed internally       | Cryptographic Protections (CRY) efforts are ad hoc and inconsistent. CMM Level 1 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- Data classification and handling criteria govern requirements to encrypt sensitive/regulated data during transmission and in storage.<br>- Network communications containing sensitive/regulated data are protected using a cryptographic mechanism to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information while in transit (e.g., SSH, TLS, VPN, etc.). <br>- Wireless access is protected via secure authentication and encryption.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Planned and tracked        | Cryptographic Protections (CRY) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- Cryptographic management is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.<br>- IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are appropriate to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for cryptographic management.<br>- Data classification and handling criteria govern requirements to encrypt sensitive/regulated data during transmission and in storage.<br>- Decentralized technologies implement cryptographic mechanisms on endpoints to control how sensitive/regulated data is encrypted during transmission and in storage.<br>- Systems, applications and services that store, process or transmit sensitive/regulated data use cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information as an alternate to physical safeguards. |
| Well defined               | Cryptographic Protections (CRY) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- Data classification and handling criteria govern requirements to encrypt sensitive/regulated data during transmission and in storage.<br>- Centrally-managed technologies implement cryptographic mechanisms on endpoints to control how sensitive/regulated data is encrypted during transmission and in storage.<br>- Systems, applications and services that store, process or transmit sensitive/regulated data use cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information as an alternate to physical safeguards.<br>- An IT infrastructure team, or similar function:<br>o	Implements Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) key management controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of keys.<br>o	Implements and maintains an internal PKI infrastructure or obtains PKI services from a reputable PKI service provider.                                                           |
| Quantitatively controllled | Cryptographic Protections (CRY) efforts are metrics driven and provide sufficient management insight (based on a quantitative understanding of process capabilities) to predict optimal performance, ensure continued operations and identify areas for improvement. In addition to CMM Level 3 criteria, CMM Level 4 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).<br>- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs).<br>- 	Scope of metrics, KPIs and KRIs covers organization-wide cybersecurity & data privacy controls, including functions performed by third-parties.<br>- 	Organizational leadership maintains a formal process to objectively review and respond to metrics, KPIs and KRIs (e.g., monthly or quarterly review).<br>- 	Based on metrics analysis, process improvement recommendations are submitted for review and are handled in accordance with change control processes.<br>- 	Both business and technical stakeholders are involved in reviewing and approving proposed changes.                    |

SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to protect wireless access via secure authentication and encryption.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
