CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- An IT Asset Management (ITAM) function, or similar function, ensures compliance with requirements for asset management.<br>- ITAM leverages a Configuration Management Database (CMDB), or similar tool, as the authoritative source of IT assets.<br>- Logical Access Control (LAC) is governed to limit the ability of non-administrators from making configuration changes to systems, applications and services.<br>- A formal Change Management (CM) program ensures that no unauthorized changes are made, that all changes are documented, that services are not disrupted and that resources are used efficiently.<br>- The CM function has formally defined roles and associated responsibilities.<br>- Changes are tracked through a centralized technology solution to submit, review, approve and assign Requests for Change (RFC).<br>- A Change Advisory Board (CAB), or similar function:<br>o	Exists to govern changes to systems, applications and services to ensure their stability, reliability and predictability. <br>o	Reviews RFC for cybersecurity & data privacy ramifications.<br>o	Notifies stakeholders to ensure awareness of the impact of proposed changes. <br>- IT personnel use dedicated development/test/staging environments to deploy and evaluate changes, wherever technically possible.<br>- Asset custodians are assigned responsibilities that cover change management duties, including privileged access to perform change management actions.<br>- File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) alerts are investigated for unauthorized changes.<br>- FIM alerts are investigated for unauthorized changes and are configured to implement remediation actions up on the detection of unauthorized baseline configurations change(s).<br>- FIM is deployed on systems that store, process or transmit sensitive/regulated/regulated data to monitor the integrity of business-critical files for tampering.<br>- Endpoint technologies detect and report changes with a centralized Change Management (CM) service to discover unauthorized changes. |
| Quantitatively controllled | Change Management (CHG) efforts are metrics driven and provide sufficient management insight (based on a quantitative understanding of process capabilities) to predict optimal performance, ensure continued operations and identify areas for improvement. In addition to CMM Level 3 criteria, CMM Level 4 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).<br>- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs).<br>- 	Scope of metrics, KPIs and KRIs covers organization-wide cybersecurity & data privacy controls, including functions performed by third-parties.<br>- 	Organizational leadership maintains a formal process to objectively review and respond to metrics, KPIs and KRIs (e.g., monthly or quarterly review).<br>- 	Based on metrics analysis, process improvement recommendations are submitted for review and are handled in accordance with change control processes.<br>- 	Both business and technical stakeholders are involved in reviewing and approving proposed changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
