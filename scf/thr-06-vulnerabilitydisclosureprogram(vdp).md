# SCF - THR-06 - Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP)
Mechanisms exist to establish a Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP) to assist with the secure development and maintenance of products and services that receives unsolicited input from the public about vulnerabilities in organizational systems, services and processes.
## Mapped framework controls
### NIST 800-53

## Control questions
Does the organization establish a Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP) to assist with the secure development and maintenance of products and services that receives unsolicited input from the public about vulnerabilities in organizational systems, services and processes?
