| Well defined               | Change Management (CHG) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- An IT Asset Management (ITAM) function, or similar function, ensures compliance with requirements for asset management.<br>- ITAM leverages a Configuration Management Database (CMDB), or similar tool, as the authoritative source of IT assets.<br>- Logical Access Control (LAC) is governed to limit the ability of non-administrators from making configuration changes to systems, applications and services.<br>- A formal Change Management (CM) program ensures that no unauthorized changes are made, that all changes are documented, that services are not disrupted and that resources are used efficiently.<br>- The CM function has formally defined roles and associated responsibilities.<br>- Changes are tracked through a centralized technology solution to submit, review, approve and assign Requests for Change (RFC).<br>- A Change Advisory Board (CAB), or similar function:<br>o	Exists to govern changes to systems, applications and services to ensure their stability, reliability and predictability. <br>o	Reviews RFC for cybersecurity & data privacy ramifications.<br>o	Notifies stakeholders to ensure awareness of the impact of proposed changes. <br>- IT personnel use dedicated development/test/staging environments to deploy and evaluate changes, wherever technically possible.<br>- Critical systems are configured to use dual authorization mechanisms requiring the approval of two authorized individuals in order to execute a change. |

SP-CMM4 is N/A, since a quantitatively-controlled process is not necessary to enforce a two-pers on rule for implementing changes to critical assets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
