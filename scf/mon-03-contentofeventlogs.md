# SCF - MON-03 - Content of Event Logs
Mechanisms exist to configure systems to produce event logs that contain sufficient information to, at a minimum:
 - Establish what type of event occurred;
 - When (date and time) the event occurred;
 - Where the event occurred;
 - The source of the event;
 - The outcome (success or failure) of the event; and 
 - The identity of any user/subject associated with the event. 
## Mapped framework controls

- [A.8.15](../iso27002/a-8.md#a815)
  
### NIST 800-53
- [AU-3](../nist80053/au-3.md)

## Control questions
Does the organization configure systems to produce event logs that contain sufficient information to, at a minimum:
 - Establish what type of event occurred;
 - When (date and time) the event occurred;
 - Where the event occurred;
 - The source of the event;
 - The outcome (success or failure) of the event; and 
 - The identity of any user/subject associated with the event?
