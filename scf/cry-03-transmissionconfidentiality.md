| Well defined               | Cryptographic Protections (CRY) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- Data classification and handling criteria govern requirements to encrypt sensitive/regulated data during transmission and in storage.<br>- Centrally-managed technologies implement cryptographic mechanisms on endpoints to control how sensitive/regulated data is encrypted during transmission and in storage.<br>- Systems, applications and services that store, process or transmit sensitive/regulated data use cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information as an alternate to physical safeguards.<br>- An IT infrastructure team, or similar function:<br>o	Implements Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) key management controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of keys.<br>o	Implements and maintains an internal PKI infrastructure or obtains PKI services from a reputable PKI service provider. <br>- Instances of non-console administrative access use cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the data being transmitted.<br>- Mobile devices containing sensitive/regulated data use a cryptographic mechanism to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information at rest (e.g., whole drive encryption). <br>- Network communications containing sensitive/regulated data use a cryptographic mechanism to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information while in transit (e.g., SSH, TLS, VPN, etc.). <br>- Wireless access is protected via secure authentication and encryption. |
