| Well defined               | Compliance (CPL) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- A Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) function, or similar function, provides governance oversight for the implementation of applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual cybersecurity & data privacy controls to ensure compliance requirements are identified and documented.<br>- The GRC function, or similar function:<br>o	Ensures data/process owners understand their requirements to manage applicable cybersecurity & data privacy controls through oversight and written guidance. <br>o	Provides applicable stakeholders with status reports on control execution to enable security controls oversight.<br>o	Works with data/process owners and asset custodians to document and validate the scope of cybersecurity & data privacy controls to ensure statutory, regulatory and/ or contractual compliance obligations are met.<br>o	Conducts cybersecurity & data privacy control assessments, on a regular cadence that is defined by the applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements.<br>- Cybersecurity and data privacy controls are centrally managed through a technology solution (e.g., GRC solution) to assign controls, track control activities and report on compliance efforts.<br>- An Audit Committee, or similar function:<br>o	Reviews the findings from security assessments and oversees long-term remediation efforts, when applicable.<br>o	Provides senior leaders with insights into the appropriateness of the organization's technology and information governance processes through recurring audits on pertinent cybersecurity & data privacy-related topics.<br>o	Governs changes to compliance operations to ensure its stability, reliability and ongoing improvement.  |
