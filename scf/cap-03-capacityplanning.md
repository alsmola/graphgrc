# CAP-03 - Capacity Planning
Mechanisms exist to conduct capacity planning so that necessary capacity for information processing, telecommunications and environmental support will exist during contingency operations. 
## Control questions
Does the organization conduct capacity planning so that necessary capacity for information processing, telecommunications and environmental support will exist during contingency operations? 
## Control maturity
### Not performed
There is no evidence of a capability to conduct capacity planning so that necessary capacity for information processing, telecommunications and environmental support will exist during contingency operations. 
### Performed internally
Capability & Performance Planning (CAP) efforts are ad hoc and inconsistent. CMM Level 1 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
•	IT personnel work with business stakeholders to identify business-critical systems and services.
•	IT personnel work with business stakeholders to identify growth requirements and add capacity accordingly.
### Planned and tracked
Capability & Performance Planning (CAP) are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
•	Capacity management is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.
•	IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are appropriate to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for capability management.
•	IT personnel work with:
o	Business stakeholders to identify business-critical systems and services.
o	Business stakeholders to identify single points of failure from a system/applications/services perspective.
•	IT infrastructure personnel:
o	Create and maintain infrastructure performance metrics to understand current resource needs.
o	Deploy preventative technologies to minimize the effect of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks against business-critical services.
### Well defined
Capability & Performance Planning (CAP) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
•	IT personnel work with business stakeholders to identify business-critical systems and services, as part of the organization’s IT Asset Management (ITAM) program.
•	Automated tools continuously monitor the operating state and health status of systems/applications/services.
•	Business stakeholders conduct a Business Impact Analysis (BIA) to determine acceptable downtime constraints and any dependencies between applications or systems, to objectively determine the criticality of systems, applications or services, as well as the order is which systems need to be restored.
•	Demand is managed for computing resources based on BIA-defined prioritization.
•	Based on BIA results, IT infrastructure personnel deploy preventative technologies to minimize the effect of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
•	IT architects identify appropriate solutions to make sure service levels can be met.
•	IT infrastructure personnel:
o	Create an annual infrastructure growth plan with input from both technology and business stakeholders.
o	Create and maintain infrastructure performance metrics to understand current resource needs.
o	Produce a capacity plan that covers current use, forecasted needs and support costs for new systems, applications and services.
•	Automated tools continuously monitor the operating state and health status of systems, applications and services.
### Quantitatively controllled
Capability & Performance Planning (CAP) efforts are metrics driven and provide sufficient management insight (based on a quantitative understanding of process capabilities) to predict optimal performance, ensure continued operations and identify areas for improvement. In addition to CMM Level 3 criteria, CMM Level 4 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs).
- 	Scope of metrics, KPIs and KRIs covers organization-wide cybersecurity & data privacy controls, including functions performed by third-parties.
- 	Organizational leadership maintains a formal process to objectively review and respond to metrics, KPIs and KRIs (e.g., monthly or quarterly review).
- 	Based on metrics analysis, process improvement recommendations are submitted for review and are handled in accordance with change control processes.
- 	Both business and technical stakeholders are involved in reviewing and approving proposed changes.
### Continuously improving
See SP-CMM4. SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to conduct capacity planning so that necessary capacity for information processing, telecommunications and environmental support will exist during contingency operations.
