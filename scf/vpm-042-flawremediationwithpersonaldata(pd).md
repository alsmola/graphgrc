CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- Attack Surface Management (ASM) is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.<br>- IT/cybersecurity personnel:<br>o	Identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for ASM.<br>o	Apply software patches and other vulnerability remediation efforts.<br>- Administrative processes and technologies focus on protecting High Value Assets (HVAs), including environments where sensitive/regulated data is stored, transmitted and processed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Well defined               | Vulnerability & Patch Management (VPM) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- An IT Asset Management (ITAM) function, or similar function, categorizes devices according to the data the asset stores, transmits and/ or processes and applies the appropriate technology controls to protect the asset and data.<br>- A Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) function, or similar function:<br>o	Defines the scope of ASM activities.<br>o	Provides governance oversight for the implementation of applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual cybersecurity & data privacy controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability and safety of the organization’s applications, systems, services and data with regards to ASM.<br>o	Provides oversight of ASM activities to centrally manage the flaw remediation process as part of the organization’s overall Patch& Vulnerability & Patch Management Program (VPMP). <br>- A Security Operations Center (SOC), or similar function:<br>o	Manages the identification, tracking and remediation of vulnerabilities.<br>o	Utilizes a Security Incident Event monitor (SIEM), or similar automated tool, to monitor for unauthorized activities, accounts, connections, devices and software according to organization-specific Indicators of Compromise (IoC), including feeds from applications, hosts, network devices and vulnerability scanners.<br>- Asset custodians install the latest stable version of security-related updates on all systems within the organization-defined time requirements.  |

In addition to CMM Level 3 criteria, CMM Level 4 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).<br>- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs).<br>- 	Scope of metrics, KPIs and KRIs covers organization-wide cybersecurity & data privacy controls, including functions performed by third-parties.<br>- 	Organizational leadership maintains a formal process to objectively review and respond to metrics, KPIs and KRIs (e.g., monthly or quarterly review).<br>- 	Based on metrics analysis, process improvement recommendations are submitted for review and are handled in accordance with change control processes.<br>- 	Both business and technical stakeholders are involved in reviewing and approving proposed changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

In addition to CMM Level 4 criteria, CMM Level 5 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- 	Stakeholders make time-sensitive decisions to support operational efficiency, which may include automated remediation actions.<br>- 	Based on predictive analysis, process improvements are implemented according to “continuous improvement” practices that affect process changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
