| Planned and tracked        | Project & Resource Management (PRM) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- Program/project management is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.<br>- IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are appropriate to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for Project Management (PM).<br>- The PM function facilitates the implementation of cybersecurity & data privacy-related resource planning controls across the System Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for all projects.<br>- The responsibility for enforcing cybersecurity & data privacy control implementation is assigned to business / process owners and asset custodians.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Well defined               | Project & Resource Management (PRM) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- A Project Management Office (PMO), or project management function, enables the centralized-implementation of cybersecurity & data privacy-related resource planning controls across the System Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for all projects.<br>- The PMO determines the identification and allocation of resources for cybersecurity & data privacy requirements within business process planning for projects and other initiatives.<br>- Project Management (PM) is centrally-managed across the enterprise to implement cybersecurity & data privacy controls as part of the project management lifecycle, with the responsibility for enforcing cybersecurity & data privacy control implementation assigned to business / process owners and asset custodians.<br>- The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), or similar function, analyzes the organization’s business strategy and prioritizes the objectives of the security function, based on business requirements.<br>- The CISO, or similar function, leverages a capability maturity model to define and identify targeted capability maturity levels for each of the functions that make up the cybersecurity & data privacy program. <br>- Subordinate staff and stakeholders are educated on the capability maturity expectations and those targets are used to task individual contributor work activities in an effort to achieve the targeted maturity levels. |

In addition to CMM Level 3 criteria, CMM Level 4 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).<br>- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs).<br>- 	Scope of metrics, KPIs and KRIs covers organization-wide cybersecurity & data privacy controls, including functions performed by third-parties.<br>- 	Organizational leadership maintains a formal process to objectively review and respond to metrics, KPIs and KRIs (e.g., monthly or quarterly review).<br>- 	Based on metrics analysis, process improvement recommendations are submitted for review and are handled in accordance with change control processes.<br>- 	Both business and technical stakeholders are involved in reviewing and approving proposed changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Continuously improving     | See SP-CMM4. SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to address all capital planning and investment requests, including the resources needed to implement the cybersecurity & data privacy programs and document all exceptions to this requirement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
