| Well defined               | Cybersecurity & Privacy Governance (GOV) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- A Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) function, or similar function, provides scoping guidance to determine control applicability.<br>- Compliance requirements for cybersecurity & data privacy controls are identified, documented and tested for adherence to internal standards or regulatory requirements. <br>- Procedures are established for sensitive/regulated obligations and standardized across the organization. <br>- Controls are standardized across the organization to ensure uniformity and consistent execution.<br>- Internal policies and standards address all statutory, regulatory and contractual obligations for cybersecurity & data privacy.<br>- Defined roles & responsibilities require data/process owners to define, implement and maintain cybersecurity & data privacy controls for each system, application and/ or service of which they have accountability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Quantitatively controllled | Cybersecurity & Privacy Governance (GOV) efforts are metrics driven and provide sufficient management insight (based on a quantitative understanding of process capabilities) to predict optimal performance, ensure continued operations and identify areas for improvement. In addition to CMM Level 3 criteria, CMM Level 4 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- 	Metrics are developed that provide management insight, per a quantitative understanding of process capabilities, to predict optimal performance, ensure continued operations and identify areas for improvement.<br>- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).<br>- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs).<br>- 	Scope of metrics, KPIs and KRIs covers organization-wide cybersecurity & data privacy controls, including functions performed by third-parties.<br>- 	Organizational leadership maintains a formal process to objectively review and respond to metrics, KPIs and KRIs (e.g., monthly or quarterly review).<br>- 	Based on metrics analysis, process improvement recommendations are submitted for review and are handled in accordance with change control processes.<br>- 	Both business and technical stakeholders are involved in reviewing and approving proposed changes. |
| Continuously improving     | Cybersecurity & Privacy Governance (GOV) efforts are “world-class” capabilities that leverage predictive analysis (e.g., machine learning, AI, etc.). In addition to CMM Level 4 criteria, CMM Level 5 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- 	Stakeholders make time-sensitive decisions to support operational efficiency, which may include automated remediation actions.<br>- 	Based on predictive analysis, process improvements are implemented according to “continuous improvement” practices that affect process changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
