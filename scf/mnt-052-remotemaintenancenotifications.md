# SCF - MNT-05.2 - Remote Maintenance Notifications
Mechanisms exist to require maintenance personnel to notify affected stakeholders when remote, non-local maintenance is planned (e.g., date/time).

## Control questions
Does the organization require maintenance personnel to notify affected stakeholders when remote, non-local maintenance is planned (e?g?, date/time)?

| Well defined               | Maintenance (MNT) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- IT/cybersecurity personnel develop and disseminate formal practices to implement enterprise-wide capability to conduct secure and timely technology asset-specific maintenance operations, including preventative and reactionary maintenance operations.<br>- Technology asset-related maintenance operations are centralized in terms of change management and governance. Local/regional practices fall under the broader enterprise-wide technology asset maintenance program.<br>- Facilities management uses an enterprise-wide process to facilitate the secure and timely implementation of non-IT maintenance operations, including preventative and reactionary maintenance operations. Local/regional practices fall under the broader enterprise-wide facilities management program.<br>- A Change Control Board (CCB), or similar function, centrally manages the process of IT and non-IT maintenance operations to reduce the chance of business interruptions from maintenance operations. <br>- Administrative processes require maintenance personnel to obtain pre-approval and scheduling for non-local maintenance sessions.<br>- Administrative processes require maintenance personnel to notify organization-defined personnel when non-local maintenance is planned (e.g., date/time).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
