| Planned and tracked        | Maintenance (MNT) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- Technology asset maintenance is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.<br>- IT/cybersecurity personnel:<br>o	Identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls to appropriately address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for technology asset maintenance.<br>o	Develop and disseminate formal guidance to facilitate a localized/regionalized process to implement secure and timely technology asset-specific maintenance operations, including preventative and reactionary maintenance operations.<br>- Maintenance controls are primarily administrative in nature (e.g., policies & standards) to manage change control processes associated with maintenance operations.<br>- Asset custodians develop and maintain formalized procedures to conduct controlled and timely maintenance activities throughout the lifecycle of the system, application or service. <br>- Maintenance operations may be centralized for certain locations (e.g., datacenters) and decentralized for other locations, both in terms of change management and execution.<br>- Facilities management uses a localized/regionalized process to facilitate the secure and timely implementation of non-IT maintenance operations, including preventative and reactionary maintenance operations.<br>- Administrative processes and technologies exist to inspect maintenance tools carried into a facility by maintenance personnel for improper or unauthorized modifications.  |
| Well defined               | Maintenance (MNT) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- IT/cybersecurity personnel develop and disseminate formal practices to implement enterprise-wide capability to conduct secure and timely technology asset-specific maintenance operations, including preventative and reactionary maintenance operations.<br>- Technology asset-related maintenance operations are centralized in terms of change management and governance. Local/regional practices fall under the broader enterprise-wide technology asset maintenance program.<br>- Facilities management uses an enterprise-wide process to facilitate the secure and timely implementation of non-IT maintenance operations, including preventative and reactionary maintenance operations. Local/regional practices fall under the broader enterprise-wide facilities management program.<br>- A Change Control Board (CCB), or similar function, centrally manages the process of IT and non-IT maintenance operations to reduce the chance of business interruptions from maintenance operations. <br>- Administrative processes and technologies exist to inspect maintenance tools carried into a facility by maintenance personnel for improper or unauthorized modifications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

In addition to CMM Level 3 criteria, CMM Level 4 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).<br>- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs).<br>- 	Scope of metrics, KPIs and KRIs covers organization-wide cybersecurity & data privacy controls, including functions performed by third-parties.<br>- 	Organizational leadership maintains a formal process to objectively review and respond to metrics, KPIs and KRIs (e.g., monthly or quarterly review).<br>- 	Based on metrics analysis, process improvement recommendations are submitted for review and are handled in accordance with change control processes.<br>- 	Both business and technical stakeholders are involved in reviewing and approving proposed changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to inspect maintenance tools carried into a facility by maintenance personnel for improper or unauthorized modifications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
