# SCF - CLD-06.1 - Customer Responsibility Matrix (CRM)
Mechanisms exist to formally document a Customer Responsibility Matrix (CRM), delineating assigned responsibilities for controls between the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and its customers.
## Mapped framework controls

## Control questions
Does the organization formally document a Customer Responsibility Matrix (CRM), delineating assigned responsibilities for controls between the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and its customers?
