CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- A Technology Infrastructure team, or similar function, defines centrally-managed network security controls for implementation across the enterprise.<br>- IT/cybersecurity architects work with the Technology Infrastructure team to implement a “layered defense” network architecture that provides a defense-in-depth approach for redundancy and risk reduction for network-based security controls, including wired and wireless networking.<br>- Administrative processes and technologies configure boundary devices (e.g., firewalls, routers, etc.) to deny network traffic by default and allow network traffic by exception (e.g., deny all, permit by exception).<br>- Technologies automate the Access Control Lists (ACLs) and similar rulesets review process to identify security issues and/ or misconfigurations. <br>- Network segmentation exists to implement separate network addresses (e.g., different subnets) to connect systems in different security domains (e.g., sensitive/regulated data environments).<br>- Technologies are configured to protect external and internal wireless links from signal parameter attacks through monitoring for unauthorized wireless connections, including scanning for unauthorized wireless access points and taking appropriate action, if an unauthorized connection is discovered.                                                                                                                                                            |
