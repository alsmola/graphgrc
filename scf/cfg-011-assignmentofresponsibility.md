| Planned and tracked        | Configuration Management (CFG) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- Configuration management is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.<br>- IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are appropriate to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for configuration management.<br>- Technologies are configured to protect data with the strength and integrity commensurate with the classification or sensitivity of the information and mostly conform to industry-recognized standards for hardening (e.g., DISA STIGs, CIS Benchmarks or OEM security guides), including cryptographic protections for sensitive/regulated data.<br>- Special baseline configurations are created for higher-risk environments or for systems, applications and services that store, process or transmit sensitive/regulated data.<br>- Apart from workstation and server operating system baselines, configuration management is decentralized.<br>- Cybersecurity personnel use a structured process to design, build and maintain secure configurations for test, development, staging and production environments.<br>- Deviations to baseline configurations are required to have a risk assessment and the business process owner acceptance of the risk(s) associated with the deviation.<br>- Unauthorized configuration changes are investigated to determine if the unauthorized configuration is malicious in nature.<br>- Logical Access Control (LAC) is enforced to prohibit non-administrative users from being able to install unauthorized software.<br>- The Human Resources (HR) department ensures industry-recognized HR practices are implemented for hiring, managing, training, investigating and terminating employees, contractors and other personnel that work on behalf of the organization.<br>- HR defines terms of employment, including acceptable and unacceptable rules of behavior for the use of technologies, including consequences for unacceptable behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Well defined               | Configuration Management (CFG) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- The configuration management function is formally assigned with defined roles and responsibilities.<br>- An IT infrastructure team, or similar function, ensures that statutory, regulatory and contractual cybersecurity & data privacy obligations are addressed to ensure secure configurations are designed, built and maintained.<br>- Configuration management is centralized for all operating systems, applications, servers and other configurable technologies.<br>- Technologies are configured to protect data with the strength and integrity commensurate with the classification or sensitivity of the information and conform to industry-recognized standards for hardening (e.g., DISA STIGs, CIS Benchmarks or OEM security guides), including test, development, staging and production environments.<br>- Configurations conform to industry-recognized standards for hardening (e.g., DISA STIGs, CIS Benchmarks or OEM security guides) for test, development, staging and production environments.<br>- Deviations to baseline configurations are required to have a risk assessment and business process owner approval of the risk(s) associated with the deviation.<br>- Special baseline configurations are created for higher-risk environments or for systems, applications and services that store, process or transmit sensitive/regulated data.<br>- An IT Asset Management (ITAM) function, or similar function, ensures compliance with requirements for asset management.<br>- Logical Access Control (LAC) is used to limit the ability of non-administrators from making configuration changes to systems, applications and services, including the of installation of unauthorized software.<br>- A Security Incident Event Manager (SIEM), or similar automated tool, monitors for unauthorized activities, accounts, connections, devices and software.<br>- Unauthorized configuration changes are responded to in accordance with an Incident Response Plan (IRP) to determine if the unauthorized configuration is malicious in nature.<br>- The Human Resources (HR) department ensures industry-recognized HR practices are implemented for hiring, managing, training, investigating and terminating employees, contractors and other personnel that work on behalf of the organization.<br>- HR defines terms of employment, including acceptable and unacceptable rules of behavior for the use of technologies, including consequences for unacceptable behavior. |
