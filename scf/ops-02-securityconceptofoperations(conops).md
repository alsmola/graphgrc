## Control questions
Does the organization develop a security Concept of Operations (CONOPS), or a similarly-defined plan for achieving cybersecurity objectives, that documents management, operational and technical measures implemented to apply defense-in-depth techniques that is communicated to all appropriate stakeholders?

| Not performed              | There is no evidence of a capability to develop a security Concept of Operations (CONOPS), or a similarly-defined plan for achieving cybersecurity objectives, that documents management, operational and technical measures implemented to apply defense-in-depth techniques that is communicated to all appropriate stakeholders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Performed internally       | SP-CMM1 is N/A, since a structured process is required to develop a security Concept of Operations (CONOPS), or a similarly-defined plan for achieving cybersecurity objectives, that documents management, operational and technical measures implemented to apply defense-in-depth techniques that is communicated to all appropriate stakeholders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Planned and tracked        | Security operations (OPS) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- Security operations management is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.<br>- IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for security operations.<br>- Administrative processes focus on protecting High Value Assets (HVAs), including environments where sensitive/regulated data is stored, transmitted and processed.                                                                                                                                      |
| Well defined               | Security Operations (OPS) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- A Security Operations Center (SOC), or similar function, manages cybersecurity operations that covers preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication and recovery.<br>- Procedures are standardized across the enterprise to ensure uniformity and consistent execution. These Standardized Operating Procedures (SOP) identify and document day-to-day procedures to enable the proper execution of assigned tasks.<br>- Line of Business (LOB) stakeholders are identified and tasked with documenting business-critical functions in “run books,” or SOPs, to capture the knowledge in documentation form from both a business and technology perspective. |
