# SCF - IAC-10.4 - Automated Support For Password Strength
Automated mechanisms exist to determine if password authenticators are sufficiently strong enough to satisfy organization-defined password length and complexity requirements. 
## Mapped framework controls
### NIST 800-53

## Control questions
Does the organization use automated mechanisms to determine if password authenticators are sufficiently strong enough to satisfy organization-defined password length and complexity requirements?
