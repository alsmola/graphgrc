CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- Training and awareness activities are decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and use non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.<br>- The Human Resources (HR) department works with cybersecurity personnel to facilitate workforce development and awareness to help ensure secure practices are implemented.<br>- Security awareness and training methods are role-based (e.g., handling sensitive/regulated data). <br>- IT/cybersecurity personnel:<br>o	Identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for security training and awareness activities.<br>o	Create/govern security and awareness training to meet specific statutory, regulatory and/ or contractual compliance obligations.<br>o	Self-manage their professional certification requirements to support their assigned duties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Well defined               | Security Awareness & Training (SAT) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- A Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) function, or similar function:<br>o	Provides governance oversight for the implementation of applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual cybersecurity & data privacy controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability and safety of the organizationâ€™s applications, systems, services and data with regards to security awareness and training.<br>o	Defines minimum cybersecurity training (including certifications) for personnel, based on their specific roles.<br>o	Creates/governs security and awareness training to meet specific statutory, regulatory and/ or contractual compliance obligations.<br>- A steering committee is formally established to provide executive oversight of the cybersecurity & data privacy program, including security awareness and training. <br>- Security awareness and training methods are role-based (e.g., handling sensitive/regulated data). <br>- The Human Resources (HR) department: <br>o	Identifies and implements industry-recognized HR practices related to security workforce development and awareness to help ensure secure practices are implemented in personnel management operations.<br>o	Documents, retains and monitors individual training activities, including basic security awareness training, ongoing awareness training and specific-system training.<br>o	Ensures that every user accessing a system processing, storing or transmitting sensitive/regulated data is formally trained in data handling requirements.<br>o	Ensures all employees and contractors receive awareness education and training that is relevant for their job function, including social engineering-related threats. |
| Quantitatively controllled | Security Awareness & Training (SAT) efforts are metrics driven and provide sufficient management insight (based on a quantitative understanding of process capabilities) to predict optimal performance, ensure continued operations and identify areas for improvement. In addition to CMM Level 3 criteria, CMM Level 4 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).<br>- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs).<br>- 	Scope of metrics, KPIs and KRIs covers organization-wide cybersecurity & data privacy controls, including functions performed by third-parties.<br>- 	Organizational leadership maintains a formal process to objectively review and respond to metrics, KPIs and KRIs (e.g., monthly or quarterly review).<br>- 	Based on metrics analysis, process improvement recommendations are submitted for review and are handled in accordance with change control processes.<br>- 	Both business and technical stakeholders are involved in reviewing and approving proposed changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Continuously improving     | See SP-CMM4. SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to include awareness training on recognizing and reporting potential and actual instances of social engineering and social mining.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
