| Well defined               | Privacy (PRI) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- A Privacy program, run by a Chief Privacy Officer (CPO), or similar role, ensures that applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual data privacy obligations are properly identified and implemented to limit and secure Personal Data (PD) that the organization stores, transmits and processes.<br>- A data privacy team oversees the centralized-management of physical security controls across the enterprise. <br>- Data Protection Officers (DPOs) are assigned to work closely with business units and project teams to ensure data privacy principles are being implemented.<br>- CPO and DPO determine and document the legal authority that permits the collection, use, maintenance and sharing of PD, either generally or in support of a specific program or system need.<br>- As part of the organization’s data privacy program, the CPO publishes a clear set of “data privacy principles”, based on leading data privacy practices, that systems, applications, services, processes and third-parties must adhere to. <br>- A Project Management Office (PMO), or project management function, ensures both cybersecurity & data privacy principles are identified and implemented within ongoing or planned projects.<br>- The CPO establishes a written charter for a Data Management Board (DMB) and assigns formal roles to selected stakeholders.<br>- The CPO operates a reporting process to internal senior management, as well as external oversight bodies, as appropriate, to demonstrate accountability with specific statutory and regulatory data privacy program mandates. |
