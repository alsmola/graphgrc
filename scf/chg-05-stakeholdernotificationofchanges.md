| Performed internally       | Change Management (CHG) efforts are ad hoc and inconsistent. CMM Level 1 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- IT personnel use an informal process to:<br>o	Govern changes to systems, applications and services to ensure their stability, reliability and predictability. <br>o	Notify stakeholders about proposed changes.<br>- Logical Access Control (LAC) limits the ability of non-administrators from making unauthorized configuration changes to systems, applications and services.<br>- Requests for Change (RFC) are submitted to IT personnel.<br>- prior to changes being made, RFCs are informally reviewed for cybersecurity & data privacy ramifications.<br>- Whenever possible, IT personnel test changes to business-critical systems/services/applications on a similarly configured IT environment as that of Production, prior to widespread production release of the change.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Planned and tracked        | Change Management (CHG) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- Change management is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.<br>- IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are appropriate to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for change management.<br>- Changes are tracked through a centralized technology solution to submit, review, approve and assign Requests for Change (RFC).<br>- A Change Advisory Board (CAB), or similar function, exists to govern changes to systems, applications and services to ensure their stability, reliability and predictability. <br>- A CAB, or similar function, reviews RFCs for cybersecurity & data privacy ramifications.<br>- A CAB, or similar function, notifies stakeholders to ensure awareness of the impact of proposed changes. <br>- Logical Access Control (LAC) limits the ability of non-administrators from making unauthorized configuration changes to systems, applications and services.<br>- Cybersecurity controls are tested after a change is implemented to ensure cybersecurity controls are operating properly.                                                                                                                      |
| Well defined               | Change Management (CHG) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- An IT Asset Management (ITAM) function, or similar function, ensures compliance with requirements for asset management.<br>- ITAM leverages a Configuration Management Database (CMDB), or similar tool, as the authoritative source of IT assets.<br>- Logical Access Control (LAC) is governed to limit the ability of non-administrators from making configuration changes to systems, applications and services.<br>- A formal Change Management (CM) program ensures that no unauthorized changes are made, that all changes are documented, that services are not disrupted and that resources are used efficiently.<br>- The CM function has formally defined roles and associated responsibilities.<br>- Changes are tracked through a centralized technology solution to submit, review, approve and assign Requests for Change (RFC).<br>- A Change Advisory Board (CAB), or similar function:<br>o	Exists to govern changes to systems, applications and services to ensure their stability, reliability and predictability. <br>o	Reviews RFC for cybersecurity & data privacy ramifications.<br>o	Notifies stakeholders to ensure awareness of the impact of proposed changes. <br>- IT personnel use dedicated development/test/staging environments to deploy and evaluate changes, wherever technically possible. |
