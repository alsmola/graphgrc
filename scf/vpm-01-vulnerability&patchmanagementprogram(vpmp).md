# SCF - VPM-01 - Vulnerability & Patch Management Program (VPMP)
Mechanisms exist to facilitate the implementation and monitoring of vulnerability management controls.
## Mapped framework controls

## Control questions
Does the organization facilitate the implementation and monitoring of vulnerability management controls?
