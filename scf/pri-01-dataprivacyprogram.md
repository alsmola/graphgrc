# PRI-01 - Data Privacy Program
Mechanisms exist to facilitate the implementation and operation of data privacy controls. 
## Mapped framework controls
### GDPR
- [Art 32.1](../gdpr/art32.md#Article.+32.1)
- [Art 32.2](../gdpr/art32.md#Article.+32.2)
- [Art 32.3](../gdpr/art32.md#Article.+32.3)
- [Art 32.4](../gdpr/art32.md#Article.+32.4)
### SOC 2
- [P1.0](../soc2/p10.md)
## Control questions
Does the organization facilitate the implementation and operation of data privacy controls?

| Planned and tracked        | Privacy (PRI) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- Privacy management is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices. <br>- The data privacy program is developed to work with IT and cybersecurity staff to ensure that applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual data privacy obligations for Personal Data (PD) are properly identified and implemented across the enterprise.<br>- IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for data privacy management.<br>- A qualified individual is formally assigned as the Chief Privacy Officer (CPO), or similar role, to lead the organization’s data privacy program. This individual may be assigned to multiple duties, including that as a Data Protection Officer (DPO).<br>- The CPO, or similar role, identifies “data privacy principles” that systems, applications, services, processes and third-parties must adhere to, based on leading data privacy practices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Well defined               | Privacy (PRI) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), or similar function, analyzes the organization’s business strategy to determine prioritized and authoritative guidance for cybersecurity-related data privacy practices.<br>- A Chief Privacy Officer (CPO), or similar function, analyzes the organization’s business strategy to develop and publish authoritative guidance on the organization’s data privacy program.<br>- The CISO, or similar function, develops a security-focused Concept of Operations (CONOPS) that documents management, operational and technical measures to apply defense-in-depth techniques across the enterprise for cybersecurity-related data privacy practices.<br>- A Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) function, or similar function, provides governance oversight for the implementation of applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual cybersecurity & data privacy controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability and safety of the organization’s applications, systems, services and data with regards to data privacy.<br>- A steering committee is formally established to provide executive oversight of the cybersecurity & data privacy program.<br>- A Privacy program, run by a CPO, or similar role, ensures that applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual data privacy obligations are properly identified and implemented to limit and secure Personal Data (PD) that the organization stores, transmits and processes.<br>- A data privacy team oversees the centralized-management of physical security controls across the enterprise. <br>- Data Protection Officers (DPOs) are assigned to work closely with business units and project teams to ensure data privacy principles are being implemented.<br>- CPO and DPO determine and document the legal authority that permits the collection, use, maintenance and sharing of PD, either generally or in support of a specific program or system need.<br>- As part of the organization’s data privacy program, the CPO publishes a clear set of “data privacy principles”, based on leading data privacy practices, that systems, applications, services, processes and third-parties must adhere to. <br>- A Project Management Office (PMO), or project management function, ensures both cybersecurity & data privacy principles are identified and implemented within ongoing or planned projects. |
| Quantitatively controllled | Privacy (PRI) efforts are metrics driven and provide sufficient management insight (based on a quantitative understanding of process capabilities) to predict optimal performance, ensure continued operations and identify areas for improvement. In addition to CMM Level 3 criteria, CMM Level 4 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).<br>- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs).<br>- 	Scope of metrics, KPIs and KRIs covers organization-wide cybersecurity & data privacy controls, including functions performed by third-parties.<br>- 	Organizational leadership maintains a formal process to objectively review and respond to metrics, KPIs and KRIs (e.g., monthly or quarterly review).<br>- 	Based on metrics analysis, process improvement recommendations are submitted for review and are handled in accordance with change control processes.<br>- 	Both business and technical stakeholders are involved in reviewing and approving proposed changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
