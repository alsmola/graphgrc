# SCF - TDA-09 - Cybersecurity & Data Privacy Testing Throughout Development
Mechanisms exist to require system developers/integrators consult with cybersecurity & data privacy personnel to: 
 - Create and implement a Security Test and Evaluation (ST&E) plan;
 - Implement a verifiable flaw remediation process to correct weaknesses and deficiencies identified during the security testing and evaluation process; and
 - Document the results of the security testing/evaluation and flaw remediation processes.
## Mapped framework controls

## Control questions
Does the organization require system developers/integrators consult with cybersecurity & data privacy personnel to: 
 - Create and implement a Security Test and Evaluation (ST&E) plan;
 - Implement a verifiable flaw remediation process to correct weaknesses and deficiencies identified during the security testing and evaluation process; and
 - Document the results of the security testing/evaluation and flaw remediation processes?
