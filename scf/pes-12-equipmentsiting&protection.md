# PES-12 - Equipment Siting & Protection
Physical security mechanisms exist to locate system components within the facility to minimize potential damage from physical and environmental hazards and to minimize the opportunity for unauthorized access. 
## Control questions
Does the organization locate system components within the facility to minimize potential damage from physical and environmental hazards and to minimize the opportunity for unauthorized access? 
## Control maturity
### Not performed
There is no evidence of a capability to locate system components within the facility to minimize potential damage from physical and environmental hazards and to minimize the opportunity for unauthorized access. 
### Performed internally
Physical & Environmental Security (PES) efforts are ad hoc and inconsistent. CMM Level 1 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
•	Physical access control is decentralized.
•	Physical security controls are primarily administrative in nature (e.g., policies & standards), focusing on protecting High Value Assets (HVAs).
•	Human Resources, or a similar function, maintains a current list of personnel and facilitates the implementation of physical access management controls.
•	Facility security mechanisms exist to protect the system from information leakage due to electromagnetic signals emanations. 
### Planned and tracked
Physical & Environmental Security (PES) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
•	Physical access control is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices. 
•	IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are appropriate to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for physical access control.
•	Human Resources, or a similar function, maintains a current list of personnel with authorized access to organizational facilities and facilitates the implementation of physical access management controls.
•	Physical security controls are primarily administrative in nature (e.g., policies & standards).
•	Physical controls, administrative processes and technologies are primarily designed and implemented for offices, rooms and facilities that focus on protecting High Value Assets (HVAs), including environments where sensitive/regulated data is stored, transmitted and processed. 
•	A facilities maintenance team, or similar function, manages the operation of automated physical and environmental protection controls.
•	Administrative processes and physical controls address system component location within the facility to minimize potential damage from physical and environmental hazards and to minimize the opportunity for unauthorized access. 
### Well defined
Physical & Environmental Security (PES) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
•	A physical security team, or similar function:
o	Performs the centralized-management of physical security controls across the enterprise. 
o	Maintains a current list of personnel with authorized access to organizational facilities and implements physical access management controls.
•	A facilities maintenance team, or similar function, manages the operation of environmental protection controls.
•	Administrative processes exist to authorize physical access to facilities based on the position or role of the individual.
•	Administrative processes and physical controls restrict unescorted access to facilities to personnel with required security clearances, formal access authorizations and validated the need for access. 
•	Administrative processes and physical controls address system component location within the facility to minimize potential damage from physical and environmental hazards and to minimize the opportunity for unauthorized access. 
### Quantitatively controllled
Physical & Environmental Security (PES) efforts are metrics driven and provide sufficient management insight (based on a quantitative understanding of process capabilities) to predict optimal performance, ensure continued operations and identify areas for improvement. In addition to CMM Level 3 criteria, CMM Level 4 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs).
- 	Scope of metrics, KPIs and KRIs covers organization-wide cybersecurity & data privacy controls, including functions performed by third-parties.
- 	Organizational leadership maintains a formal process to objectively review and respond to metrics, KPIs and KRIs (e.g., monthly or quarterly review).
- 	Based on metrics analysis, process improvement recommendations are submitted for review and are handled in accordance with change control processes.
- 	Both business and technical stakeholders are involved in reviewing and approving proposed changes.
### Continuously improving
See SP-CMM4. SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to locate system components within the facility to minimize potential damage from physical and environmental hazards and to minimize the opportunity for unauthorized access.
