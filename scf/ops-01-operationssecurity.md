| Planned and tracked        | Security operations (OPS) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- Security operations management is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.<br>- IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for security operations.<br>- Administrative processes focus on protecting High Value Assets (HVAs), including environments where sensitive/regulated data is stored, transmitted and processed.<br>- Critical business functions are documented in “run books” or Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) to capture operational knowledge in documentation form.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Well defined               | Security Operations (OPS) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), or similar function, analyzes the organization’s business strategy to determine prioritized and authoritative guidance for cybersecurity operations practices.<br>- The CISO, or similar function, develops a security-focused Concept of Operations (CONOPS) that documents management, operational and technical measures to apply defense-in-depth techniques across the enterprise for cybersecurity operations.<br>- A Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) function, or similar function, provides governance oversight for the implementation of applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual cybersecurity & data privacy controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability and safety of the organization’s applications, systems, services and data with regards to cybersecurity operations.<br>- A steering committee is formally established to provide executive oversight of the cybersecurity & data privacy program, including cybersecurity operations. <br>- A Security Operations Center (SOC), or similar function, manages cybersecurity operations that covers preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication and recovery.<br>- Procedures are standardized across the enterprise to ensure uniformity and consistent execution. These Standardized Operating Procedures (SOP) identify and document day-to-day procedures to enable the proper execution of assigned tasks.<br>- Line of Business (LOB) stakeholders are identified and tasked with documenting business-critical functions in “run books,” or SOPs, to capture the knowledge in documentation form from both a business and technology perspective. |
| Quantitatively controllled | Security Operations (OPS) efforts are metrics driven and provide sufficient management insight (based on a quantitative understanding of process capabilities) to predict optimal performance, ensure continued operations and identify areas for improvement. In addition to CMM Level 3 criteria, CMM Level 4 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).<br>- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs).<br>- 	Scope of metrics, KPIs and KRIs covers organization-wide cybersecurity & data privacy controls, including functions performed by third-parties.<br>- 	Organizational leadership maintains a formal process to objectively review and respond to metrics, KPIs and KRIs (e.g., monthly or quarterly review).<br>- 	Based on metrics analysis, process improvement recommendations are submitted for review and are handled in accordance with change control processes.<br>- 	Both business and technical stakeholders are involved in reviewing and approving proposed changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to facilitate the implementation of operational security controls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
