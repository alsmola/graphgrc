# SCF - TDA-19 - Error Handling
Mechanisms exist to handle error conditions by: 
 - Identifying potentially security-relevant error conditions;
 - Generating error messages that provide information necessary for corrective actions without revealing sensitive or potentially harmful information in error logs and administrative messages that could be exploited; and
 - Revealing error messages only to authorized personnel.

## Control questions
Does the organization handle error conditions by: 
 - Identifying potentially security-relevant error conditions;
 - Generating error messages that provide information necessary for corrective actions without revealing sensitive or potentially harmful information in error logs and administrative messages that could be exploited; and
 - Revealing error messages only to authorized personnel?
