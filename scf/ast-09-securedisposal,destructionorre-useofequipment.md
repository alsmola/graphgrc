| Planned and tracked        | Asset Management (AST) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- Asset management is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.<br>- IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are appropriate to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for asset management.<br>- Administrative processes and technologies focus on protecting High Value Assets (HVAs), including environments where sensitive/regulated data is stored, transmitted and processed.<br>- Asset management is formally assigned as an additional duty to existing IT/cybersecurity personnel.<br>- Technology assets are categorized according to data classification and business criticality.<br>- Inventories cover technology assets in scope for statutory, regulatory and/ or contractual compliance, which includes both physical and virtual assets.<br>- Software licensing is tracked as part of IT asset inventories.<br>- Users are educated on their responsibilities to protect technology assets assigned to them or under their supervision. <br>- IT/cybersecurity personnel maintain network diagrams to document the flow of sensitive/regulated data across the network.<br>- IT personnel collect technology assets and media for destruction when it is no longer needed for business or legal reasons.<br>- IT personnel perform the destruction of technology assets and media in a secure manner or outsource the destruction to a third-party that specializes in technology assets and media destruction, as well as provides evidence of destruction (e.g., certificate of destruction).<br>- Devices are escrowed in storage for a period of time before being wiped and reissued, in case data on the devices are needed for investigations or business purposes. |
| Well defined               | Asset Management (AST) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- An IT Asset Management (ITAM) function, or similar function, governs asset management to help ensure compliance with requirements for asset management.<br>- An ITAM function, or similar function, maintains an inventory of IT assets, covering both physical and virtual assets, as well as centrally managed asset ownership assignments.<br>- Technology assets and data are categorized according to data classification and business criticality criteria.<br>- A Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) function oversees supply chain risks including the removal and prevention of certain technology services and/ or equipment designated as supply chain threats by a statutory or regulatory body.<br>- Data/process owners document where sensitive/regulated data is stored, transmitted and processed, generating Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) and network diagrams to document the flow of data.<br>- IT personnel perform the destruction of technology assets and media in a secure manner or outsource the destruction to a third-party that specializes in technology assets and media destruction, as well as provides evidence of destruction (e.g., certificate of destruction).<br>- Organizational standards exist for users to dispose of, destroy or repurpose system components when it is no longer needed for business or legal reasons.<br>- Third-party providers ensure world-wide coverage to securely dispose of, destroy or repurpose system components using organization-defined techniques and methods to prevent such components from entering the gray market.<br>- Devices are escrowed in storage for a period of time before being wiped and reissued, in case data on the devices are needed for investigations or business purposes.                                                                          |

SP-CMM4 is N/A, since a quantitatively-controlled process is not necessary to securely dispose of, destroy or repurpose system components using organization-defined techniques and methods to prevent information being recovered from these components.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
