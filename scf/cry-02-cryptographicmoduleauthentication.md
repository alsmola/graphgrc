| Planned and tracked        | Cryptographic Protections (CRY) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- Cryptographic management is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.<br>- IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are appropriate to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for cryptographic management.<br>- Data classification and handling criteria govern requirements to encrypt sensitive/regulated data during transmission and in storage.<br>- Decentralized technologies implement cryptographic mechanisms on endpoints to control how sensitive/regulated data is encrypted during transmission and in storage.<br>- Systems, applications and services that store, process or transmit sensitive/regulated data use cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information as an alternate to physical safeguards. |
