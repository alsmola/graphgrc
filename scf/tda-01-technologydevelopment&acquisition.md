# TDA-01 - Technology Development & Acquisition
Mechanisms exist to facilitate the implementation of tailored development and acquisition strategies, contract tools and procurement methods to meet unique business needs.
## Control questions
Does the organization facilitate the implementation of tailored development and acquisition strategies, contract tools and procurement methods to meet unique business needs?
## Control maturity
### Not performed
There is no evidence of a capability to facilitate the implementation of tailored development and acquisition strategies, contract tools and procurement methods to meet unique business needs.
### Performed internally
Technology Development & Acquisition (TDA) efforts are ad hoc and inconsistent. CMM Level 1 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
•	IT personnel use an informal process to govern technology development and acquisition.
•	Secure development practices loosely conform to industry-recognized standards for secure engineering (e.g., OWASP, NIST SP 800-218, NIST SP 800-160, etc.). 
•	IT personnel work with data/process owners to help ensure secure practices are implemented throughout the System Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for all high-value projects.
•	Project management is decentralized and generally lacks formal project management managers or broader oversight.
### Planned and tracked
Technology Development & Acquisition (TDA) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
•	Development and acquisition management is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.
•	IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for technology development and acquisition management.
•	IT/cybersecurity personnel implement secure practices to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability and safety of the organization’s technology assets, data and network(s).
•	Secure development practices mostly conform to industry-recognized standards for secure engineering (e.g., OWASP, NIST SP 800-218, NIST SP 800-160, etc.). 
•	Procurement practices require third-party developers of systems, system components or services to follow secure engineering practices. 
•	A Project Management office (PMO), or project management function, enables the implementation of cybersecurity & data privacy-related resource planning controls across the System Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for all high-value projects.
### Well defined
Technology Development & Acquisition (TDA) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
•	The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), or similar function, analyzes the organization’s business strategy to determine prioritized and authoritative guidance for technology development and acquisition practices.
•	The CISO, or similar function, develops a security-focused Concept of Operations (CONOPS) that documents management, operational and technical measures to apply defense-in-depth techniques across the enterprise for technology development and acquisition.
•	A steering committee is formally established to provide executive oversight of the cybersecurity & data privacy program, including technology development and acquisition. 
•	A Validated Architecture Design Review (VADR) evaluates design criteria for secure practices and conformance with requirements for applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual controls to determine if the system/application/service is designed, built and operated in a secure and resilient manner.
•	Secure development practices conform to industry-recognized standards for secure engineering (e.g., OWASP, NIST SP 800-218, NIST SP 800-160, etc.). 
•	A procurement team, or similar function, ensures that third party development and/ or acquisitions meet, or exceed, the organization's business, cybersecurity & data privacy requirements to have secure and resilient systems, applications, services and processes.
•	A Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) governs a secure development lifecycle for the development of systems, applications and services.
•	Administrative processes exist and technologies are configured to implement secure configuration settings by default to reduce the likelihood of software being deployed with weak security settings, putting the asset at a greater risk of compromise.
•	An IT Asset Management (ITAM) function, or similar function, categorizes devices according to the data the asset stores, transmits and/ or processes and applies the appropriate technology controls to protect the asset and data.
•	A formal Change Management (CM) program help to ensure that no unauthorized changes are made, all changes are documented, services are not disrupted and resources are used efficiently.
•	A Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) function, or similar function;
o	Provides governance oversight for the implementation of applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual cybersecurity & data privacy controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability and safety of the organization’s applications, systems, services and data for technology development and acquisition.
o	Ensures the Information Assurance Program (IAP) evaluates applicable cybersecurity & data privacy controls as part of “business as usual” pre-production testing. 
o	Operates the Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) program to identify and mitigate supply chain-related risks and threats.
•	A Project Management Office (PMO), or project management function, enables IAP pre-production testing of cybersecurity & data privacy controls as part of the organization’s established project management processes.
### Quantitatively controllled
See SP-CMM3. SP-CMM4 is N/A, since a quantitatively-controlled process is not necessary to facilitate the implementation of tailored development and acquisition strategies, contract tools and procurement methods to meet unique business needs.
### Continuously improving
See SP-CMM4. SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to facilitate the implementation of tailored development and acquisition strategies, contract tools and procurement methods to meet unique business needs.
