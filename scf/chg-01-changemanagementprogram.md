# CHG-01 - Change Management Program
Mechanisms exist to facilitate the implementation of a change management program.
## Mapped framework controls
### SOC 2
- [CC3.4](../soc2/cc34.md)
- [CC8.1](../soc2/cc81.md)
### GDPR
- [Art 32.1](../gdpr/art321.md)
- [Art 32.2](../gdpr/art322.md)
## Control questions
Does the organization facilitate the implementation of a change management program?
