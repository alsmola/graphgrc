| Performed internally       | Asset Management (AST) efforts are ad hoc and inconsistent. CMM Level 1 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- Asset management is informally assigned as an additional duty to existing IT/cybersecurity personnel.<br>- Asset inventories are performed in an ad hoc manner.<br>- Software licensing is tracked as part of IT asset inventories.<br>- Data process owners maintain limited network diagrams to document the flow of sensitive/regulated data that is specific to their initiative.<br>- IT personnel work with data/process owners to help ensure secure practices are implemented throughout the System Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for all high-value projects.<br>- Inventory of physical technology assets are assigned to individual users or teams and covers common devices (e.g., laptops, workstations and servers).<br>- Organizational policies and standards cover:<br>o	Enhanced security requirements for unattended systems (e.g., kiosks, ATMs, etc.) and point of sale devices. <br>o	Media handling requirements for users.<br>o	Requirements for approving assets from entering or existing facilities.<br>o	Requirements for users to dispose of, destroy or repurpose system components when it is no longer needed for business or legal reasons. <br>o	Requirements for users to secure laptops while traveling.<br>o	Software licensing restrictions for users, as part of acceptable and unacceptable behaviors.<br>o	Use of personal devices (e.g., Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), as part of acceptable and unacceptable behaviors.<br>o	Use of third-party devices, as part of acceptable and unacceptable behaviors. |
| Planned and tracked        | Asset Management (AST) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- Asset management is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.<br>- IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are appropriate to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for asset management.<br>- Administrative processes and technologies focus on protecting High Value Assets (HVAs), including environments where sensitive/regulated data is stored, transmitted and processed.<br>- Asset management is formally assigned as an additional duty to existing IT/cybersecurity personnel.<br>- Technology assets are categorized according to data classification and business criticality.<br>- Inventories cover technology assets in scope for statutory, regulatory and/ or contractual compliance, which includes both physical and virtual assets.<br>- Software licensing is tracked as part of IT asset inventories.<br>- Users are educated on their responsibilities to protect technology assets assigned to them or under their supervision. <br>- IT/cybersecurity personnel maintain network diagrams to document the flow of sensitive/regulated data across the network.<br>- Data/process owners for business-critical assets are documented and are reviewed as part of the annual asset inventories.                                                    |
| Well defined               | Asset Management (AST) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- An IT Asset Management (ITAM) function, or similar function, governs asset management to help ensure compliance with requirements for asset management.<br>- An ITAM function, or similar function, maintains an inventory of IT assets, covering both physical and virtual assets, as well as centrally managed asset ownership assignments.<br>- Technology assets and data are categorized according to data classification and business criticality criteria.<br>- A Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) function oversees supply chain risks including the removal and prevention of certain technology services and/ or equipment designated as supply chain threats by a statutory or regulatory body.<br>- Data/process owners document where sensitive/regulated data is stored, transmitted and processed, generating Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) and network diagrams to document the flow of data.<br>- Stakeholders leverage ITAM tools to create and maintain an inventory of systems, applications and services, that need to adhere to statutory, regulatory and/ or contractual requirements, with sufficient detail to determine control applicability.<br>- Users are educated on their responsibilities to protect technology assets assigned to them or under their supervision. <br>- Data/process owners for business-critical assets are documented and are reviewed as part of the annual asset inventories.    |
