## Control questions
Does the organization compel data and/or process owners to operationalize cybersecurity & data privacy practices for each system, application and/or service under their control?

| Well defined               | Cybersecurity & Privacy Governance (GOV) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- A Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) function, or similar function, provides scoping guidance to determine control applicability.<br>- Compliance requirements for cybersecurity & data privacy controls are identified, documented and tested for adherence to internal standards or regulatory requirements. <br>- Procedures are established for sensitive/regulated obligations and standardized across the organization. <br>- Controls are standardized across the organization to ensure uniformity and consistent execution.<br>- Internal policies and standards address all statutory, regulatory and contractual obligations for cybersecurity & data privacy.<br>- Defined roles & responsibilities require data/process owners to define, implement and maintain cybersecurity & data privacy controls for each system, application and/ or service of which they have accountability. |
