# GOV-15 - Operationalizing Cybersecurity & Data Protection Practices
Mechanisms exist to compel data and/or process owners to operationalize cybersecurity & data privacy practices for each system, application and/or service under their control.
## Control questions
Does the organization compel data and/or process owners to operationalize cybersecurity & data privacy practices for each system, application and/or service under their control?
## Control maturity
### Not performed
There is no evidence of a capability to compel data and/ or process owners to operationalize cybersecurity & data privacy practices for each system, application and/ or service under their control.
### Performed internally
SP-CMM1 is N/A, since a structured process is required to compel data and/ or process owners to operationalize cybersecurity & data privacy practices for each system, application and/ or service under their control.
### Planned and tracked
SP-CMM2 is N/A, since a well-defined process is required to compel data and/ or process owners to operationalize cybersecurity & data privacy practices for each system, application and/ or service under their control.
### Well defined
Cybersecurity & Privacy Governance (GOV) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:
•	A Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) function, or similar function, provides scoping guidance to determine control applicability.
•	Compliance requirements for cybersecurity & data privacy controls are identified, documented and tested for adherence to internal standards or regulatory requirements. 
•	Procedures are established for sensitive/regulated obligations and standardized across the organization. 
•	Controls are standardized across the organization to ensure uniformity and consistent execution.
•	Internal policies and standards address all statutory, regulatory and contractual obligations for cybersecurity & data privacy.
•	Defined roles & responsibilities require data/process owners to define, implement and maintain cybersecurity & data privacy controls for each system, application and/ or service of which they have accountability.
### Quantitatively controllled
See SP-CMM3. SP-CMM4 is N/A, since a quantitatively-controlled process is not necessary to compel data and/ or process owners to operationalize cybersecurity & data privacy practices for each system, application and/ or service under their control.
### Continuously improving
See SP-CMM4. SP-CMM5 is N/A, since a continuously-improving process is not necessary to compel data and/ or process owners to operationalize cybersecurity & data privacy practices for each system, application and/ or service under their control.
