| Planned and tracked        | Physical & Environmental Security (PES) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- Physical access control is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices. <br>- IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are appropriate to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for physical access control.<br>- Human Resources, or a similar function, maintains a current list of personnel with authorized access to organizational facilities and facilitates the implementation of physical access management controls.<br>- Physical security controls are primarily administrative in nature (e.g., policies & standards).<br>- Physical controls, administrative processes and technologies are primarily designed and implemented for offices, rooms and facilities that focus on protecting High Value Assets (HVAs), including environments where sensitive/regulated data is stored, transmitted and processed. <br>- A facilities maintenance team, or similar function, manages the operation of automated physical and environmental protection controls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Well defined               | Physical & Environmental Security (PES) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), or similar function, analyzes the organizationâ€™s business strategy to determine prioritized and authoritative guidance for physical access control practices.<br>- The CISO, or similar function, develops a security-focused Concept of Operations (CONOPS) that documents management, operational and technical measures to apply defense-in-depth techniques across the enterprise for physical access controls.<br>- A Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) function, or similar function, provides governance oversight for the implementation of applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual cybersecurity & data privacy controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability and safety of the organizationâ€™s applications, systems, services and data with regards to physical access controls.<br>- A steering committee is formally established to provide executive oversight of the cybersecurity & data privacy program, including physical access controls. <br>- A physical security team, or similar function:<br>o	Performs the centralized-management of physical security controls across the enterprise. <br>o	Maintains a current list of personnel with authorized access to organizational facilities and implements physical access management controls.<br>- A facilities maintenance team, or similar function, manages the operation of environmental protection controls.<br>- Administrative processes exist to authorize physical access to facilities based on the position or role of the individual.<br>- Administrative processes and physical controls restrict unescorted access to facilities to personnel with required security clearances, formal access authorizations and validated the need for access.  |
| Quantitatively controllled | Physical & Environmental Security (PES) efforts are metrics driven and provide sufficient management insight (based on a quantitative understanding of process capabilities) to predict optimal performance, ensure continued operations and identify areas for improvement. In addition to CMM Level 3 criteria, CMM Level 4 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).<br>- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs).<br>- 	Scope of metrics, KPIs and KRIs covers organization-wide cybersecurity & data privacy controls, including functions performed by third-parties.<br>- 	Organizational leadership maintains a formal process to objectively review and respond to metrics, KPIs and KRIs (e.g., monthly or quarterly review).<br>- 	Based on metrics analysis, process improvement recommendations are submitted for review and are handled in accordance with change control processes.<br>- 	Both business and technical stakeholders are involved in reviewing and approving proposed changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
