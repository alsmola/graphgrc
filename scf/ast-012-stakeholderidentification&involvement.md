| Not performed              | There is no evidence of a capability to identify and involve pertinent stakeholders of critical systems, applications and services to support the ongoing secure management of those assets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Performed internally       | Asset Management (AST) efforts are ad hoc and inconsistent. CMM Level 1 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- Asset management is informally assigned as an additional duty to existing IT/cybersecurity personnel.<br>- Asset inventories are performed in an ad hoc manner.<br>- Software licensing is tracked as part of IT asset inventories.<br>- Data process owners maintain limited network diagrams to document the flow of sensitive/regulated data that is specific to their initiative.<br>- IT personnel work with data/process owners to help ensure secure practices are implemented throughout the System Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for all high-value projects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Planned and tracked        | Asset Management (AST) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- Asset management is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.<br>- IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are appropriate to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for asset management.<br>- Administrative processes and technologies focus on protecting High Value Assets (HVAs), including environments where sensitive/regulated data is stored, transmitted and processed.<br>- Asset management is formally assigned as an additional duty to existing IT/cybersecurity personnel.<br>- Technology assets are categorized according to data classification and business criticality.<br>- Inventories cover technology assets in scope for statutory, regulatory and/ or contractual compliance, which includes both physical and virtual assets.<br>- Software licensing is tracked as part of IT asset inventories.<br>- Users are educated on their responsibilities to protect technology assets assigned to them or under their supervision. <br>- IT/cybersecurity personnel maintain network diagrams to document the flow of sensitive/regulated data across the network. |
| Well defined               | Asset Management (AST) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- An IT Asset Management (ITAM) function, or similar function, governs asset management to help ensure compliance with requirements for asset management.<br>- An ITAM function, or similar function, maintains an inventory of IT assets, covering both physical and virtual assets, as well as centrally managed asset ownership assignments.<br>- Technology assets and data are categorized according to data classification and business criticality criteria.<br>- A Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) function oversees supply chain risks including the removal and prevention of certain technology services and/ or equipment designated as supply chain threats by a statutory or regulatory body.<br>- Data/process owners document where sensitive/regulated data is stored, transmitted and processed, generating Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) and network diagrams to document the flow of data.<br>- Quarterly IT asset inventories are reviewed and shared with appropriate stakeholders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Quantitatively controllled | Asset Management (AST) efforts are metrics driven and provide sufficient management insight (based on a quantitative understanding of process capabilities) to predict optimal performance, ensure continued operations and identify areas for improvement.<br>- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).<br>- 	Metrics reporting includes quantitative analysis of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs).<br>- 	Scope of metrics, KPIs and KRIs covers organization-wide cybersecurity & data privacy controls, including functions performed by third-parties.<br>- 	Organizational leadership maintains a formal process to objectively review and respond to metrics, KPIs and KRIs (e.g., monthly or quarterly review).<br>- 	Based on metrics analysis, process improvement recommendations are submitted for review and are handled in accordance with change control processes.<br>- 	Both business and technical stakeholders are involved in reviewing and approving proposed changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
