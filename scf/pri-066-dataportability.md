## Control questions
Does the organization export Personal Data (PD) in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format that allows the data subject to transmit the data to another controller without hindrance?

| Planned and tracked        | Privacy (PRI) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- Privacy management is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices. <br>- The data privacy program is developed to work with IT and cybersecurity staff to ensure that applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual data privacy obligations for Personal Data (PD) are properly identified and implemented across the enterprise.<br>- IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for data privacy management.<br>- A qualified individual is formally assigned as the Chief Privacy Officer (CPO), or similar role, to lead the organization’s data privacy program. This individual may be assigned to multiple duties, including that as a Data Protection Officer (DPO).<br>- The CPO, or similar role, identifies “data privacy principles” that systems, applications, services, processes and third-parties must adhere to, based on leading data privacy practices.                                                                                                                                                       |

CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- A Privacy program, run by a Chief Privacy Officer (CPO), or similar role, ensures that applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual data privacy obligations are properly identified and implemented to limit and secure Personal Data (PD) that the organization stores, transmits and processes.<br>- A data privacy team oversees the centralized-management of physical security controls across the enterprise. <br>- Data Protection Officers (DPOs) are assigned to work closely with business units and project teams to ensure data privacy principles are being implemented.<br>- CPO and DPO determine and document the legal authority that permits the collection, use, maintenance and sharing of PD, either generally or in support of a specific program or system need.<br>- As part of the organization’s data privacy program, the CPO publishes a clear set of “data privacy principles”, based on leading data privacy practices, that systems, applications, services, processes and third-parties must adhere to. <br>- A Project Management Office (PMO), or project management function, ensures both cybersecurity & data privacy principles are identified and implemented within ongoing or planned projects. |
