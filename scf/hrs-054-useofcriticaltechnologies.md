| Performed internally       | Human Resources Security (HRS) efforts are ad hoc and inconsistent. CMM Level 1 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- Personnel management is decentralized, with the responsibility for training users and enforcing policies being assigned to the user’s immediate supervisor(s)/manager(s), including the definition and enforcement of the user’s specific role(s) and responsibilities.<br>- The Human Resources (HR) department provides guidance on HR practices for hiring, retaining and terminating employees, contractors and other personnel that work on behalf of the organization.<br>- Terms of employment, including acceptable and unacceptable rules of behavior for the use of technologies, including consequences for unacceptable behavior are at the discretion of users’ management.<br>- Administrative processes require all employees and contractors to apply cybersecurity & data privacy principles in their daily work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Planned and tracked        | Human Resources Security (HRS) efforts are requirements-driven and formally governed at a local/regional level, but are not consistent across the organization. CMM Level 2 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- Personnel management is decentralized (e.g., a localized/regionalized function) and uses non-standardized methods to implement secure and compliant practices.<br>- IT/cybersecurity personnel identify cybersecurity & data privacy controls that are appropriate to address applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for personnel management. <br>- The Human Resources (HR) department:<br>o	Ensures industry-recognized HR practices are implemented for hiring, managing, training, investigating and terminating employees, contractors and other personnel that work on behalf of the organization.<br>o	Defines terms of employment, including acceptable and unacceptable rules of behavior for the use of technologies, including consequences for unacceptable behavior.<br>- The responsibility for training users and enforcing policies being assigned to user’s immediate supervisor(s)/manager(s), including the definition and enforcement of the user’s specific role(s) and responsibilities.<br>- Personnel managers ensure personnel are routinely made aware of the organization’s cybersecurity / data privacy policies and provide acknowledgement.<br>- Administrative processes require all employees and contractors to apply cybersecurity & data privacy principles in their daily work. |
| Well defined               | Human Resources Security (HRS) efforts are standardized across the organization and centrally managed, where technically feasible, to ensure consistency. CMM Level 3 control maturity would reasonably expect all, or at least most, the following criteria to exist:<br>- The Human Resources (HR) department:<br>o	Ensures industry-recognized HR practices are implemented for hiring, managing, training, investigating and terminating employees, contractors and other personnel that work on behalf of the organization.<br>o	Ensures that every user accessing a system that processes, stores, or transmits sensitive/regulated data is cleared and regularly trained in proper data handling practices. <br>o	Identifies and implements industry-recognized HR practices related to cybersecurity & data privacy training and awareness to help ensure secure practices are implemented in personnel operations to help manage risk to both technology assets and data.<br>o	Manages personnel security risk by assigning a risk designation to all positions and establishing screening criteria for individuals filling those positions.<br>- Administrative processes require Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) or similar confidentiality agreements that reflect the needs to protect data and operational details, for both employees and third-parties.<br>- Rules of behavior affecting the use of critical technologies reflects the organization's corporate culture and risk threshold.                                                                                                                    |
